its music was created with the intention of listening and contemplation rather than for dancing , and is often distinguished by the use of electronic effects and easy listening textures far removed from the propulsive rhythms of early rock .
the term may sometimes be used interchangeably with `` progressive rock '' , though the latter is instead characterized in particular by its employment of classically trained instrumental technique and symphonic textures .
== definitions == critic john rockwell says that art rock is one of rock 's most wide-ranging and eclectic genres with its overt sense of creative detachment , classical music pretensions , and experimental , avant-garde proclivities .
in the rock music of the 1970s , the `` art '' descriptor was generally understood to mean `` aggressively avant-garde '' or `` pretentiously progressive '' .
`` art rock '' is often used synonymously with progressive rock .
historically , the term has been used to describe at least two related , but distinct , types of rock music .
the first is progressive rock , while the second usage refers to groups who rejected psychedelia and the hippie counterculture in favor of a modernist , avant-garde approach defined by the velvet underground .
art rock emphasizes romantic and autonomous traditions , in distinction to the aesthetic of the everyday and the disposable embodied by art pop .
differences have been identified between art rock and progressive rock , with art rock emphasizing avant-garde or experimental influences and `` novel sonic structure '' , while progressive rock has been characterized as putting a greater emphasis on classically trained instrumental technique , literary content , and symphonic features .
compared to progressive rock , art rock is `` more challenging , noisy and unconventional '' and `` less classically influenced '' , with more of an emphasis on avant-garde music .
similarities are that they both describe a mostly british attempt to elevate rock music to new levels of artistic credibility , and became the instrumental analog to concept albums and rock operas , which were typically more vocal oriented .
art rock can also to refer to either classically driven rock , or a progressive rock-folk fusion .
`` == history == === 1960s === ==== background ==== the boundaries between art and pop music became increasingly blurred throughout the second half of the 20th century .
the first usage of the term `` art rock '' , according to merriam-webster online dictionary , was in 1968 .
as pop music 's dominant format transitioned from singles to albums , many rock bands created works that aspired to make grand artistic statements , where art rock would flourish .
as it progressed in the late 1960s  in tandem with the development of progressive rock  art rock acquired notoriety alongside experimental rock .
==== proponents ==== the earliest figure of art rock has been assumed to be record producer and songwriter phil spector , who became known as an auteur for his wall of sound productions that aspired to a `` classical grandiosity '' .
biographer peter ames carlin wrote that wilson was the forerunner of `` a new kind of art-rock that would combine the transcendent possibilities of art with the mainstream accessibility of pop music '' .
critic stephen holden says that mid-1960s recordings by the beatles , spector and wilson are often identified as marking the start of art pop , which preceded the `` bombastic , classically inflected '' art rock that started in the late 1960s .
many of the top british groups during the 1960s  including members of the beatles , the rolling stones , the kinks , the who , the move , the yardbirds and pink floyd  came to music via art school .
by the mid-1960s , several of these acts espoused an approach based on art and originality , where previously they had been absorbed solely in authentic interpretation of us-derived musical styles , such as rock 'n ' roll and r & b .
`` author matthew bannister traces `` the more self-conscious , camp aesthetic of art rock '' to pop artist andy warhol and the velvet underground , who emulated warhol 's art/pop synthesis .
accordingly : `` warhol took spector 's combination of the disembodiment , 'distance ' and refinement of high culture with the 'immediacy ' of mass cultural forms like rock and roll several stages further ...
but warhols aesthetic was more thoroughly worked out than spector 's , which represented a transitional phase between old-fashioned auteurism and the thoroughly postmodern , detached tenets of pop art .
... warhol 's approach reverberates throughout art rock , most obviously in his stance of distance and disengagement .
`` ==== influential albums ==== ===== 196566 ===== the december 1965 release of the beatles ' rubber soul signified a watershed for the pop album , transforming it in scope from a collection of singles with lesser-quality tracks to a distinct art form , filled with high-quality original compositions .
the period when rock music became most closely aligned with art began in 1966 , the year in which the beach boys ' pet sounds and the mothers of invention 's freak out !
academic michael johnson associates `` the first documented moments of ascension in rock music '' to pet sounds .
`` pet sounds is also noted as the first rock concept album .
in 1971 , cue magazine described the beach boys as having been `` among the vanguard '' with regard to art rock , among many other aspects relating to the counterculture , over the period up to late 1967 .
jacqueline edmondson 's 2013 encyclopedia music in american life states that , although it was preceded by earlier examples , frank zappa and the mothers of invention 's debut album freak out !
( june 1966 ) came to be seen as `` the first successful incorporation of art music in a pop context '' .
the beatles ' revolver ( august 1966 ) furthered the album-as-art perspective and continued pop music 's evolution .
according to rolling stone , `` revolver signaled that in popular music , anything  any theme , any musical idea  could now be realized .
`` as with rubber soul , the album inspired many of the progressive rock artists of the 1970s , and each of its songs has been recognised as anticipating a new subgenre or style .
bannister writes of the velvet underground : `` no other band exerted the same grip on the minds of 1970s/1980s art/alternative rock artists , writers and audiences .
`` the beatles ' paul mccartney deemed pet sounds `` the record of the time '' , and in june 1967 , the band responded with their own album : sgt .
allmusic states that the first wave of art rock musicians were inspired by sgt .
pepper 's and believed that for rock music to grow artistically , they should incorporate elements of european and classical music to the genre .
many british groups flowered in the album 's wake ; those who are listed in music in american life include the moody blues , the strawbs , genesis , and `` most notably '' , pink floyd .
=== 1970s90s === art rock 's greatest level of popularity was in the early 1970s through british artists .
enthusiasm for art rock explorations waned in the mid 1970s .
from then to the 1990s , art rock was infused within various popular music genres .
`` in the 1980s , a new generation of english art rockers took the place of 1970s bands like yes , genesis , jethro tull and emerson , lake & palmer .
when the band 's colin moulding was asked whether he felt the band was closer to art rock or new wave , he responded ; `` we 've always had the art-rock appeal rather than street credibility .
charles edward anderson berry ( october 18 , 1926  march 18 , 2017 ) was an american guitarist , singer and songwriter and one of the pioneers of rock and roll music .
writing lyrics that focused on teen life and consumerism , and developing a music style that included guitar solos and showmanship , berry was a major influence on subsequent rock music .
by early 1953 , influenced by the guitar riffs and showmanship techniques of the blues musician t-bone walker , berry began performing with the johnnie johnson trio .
with chess , he recorded `` maybellene '' berry 's adaptation of the country song `` ida red '' which sold over a million copies , reaching number one on billboard magazine 's rhythm and blues chart .
but these did not achieve the same success , or lasting impact , of his 1950s songs , and by the 1970s he was more in demand as a nostalgic performer , playing his past hits with local backup bands of variable quality .
berry was among the first musicians to be inducted into the rock and roll hall of fame on its opening in 1986 ; he was cited for having `` laid the groundwork for not only a rock and roll sound but a rock and roll stance .
he was convicted and sent to the intermediate reformatory for young men at algoa , near jefferson city , missouri , where he formed a singing quartet and did some boxing .
the singing group became competent enough that the authorities allowed it to perform outside the detention facility .
he had been playing blues since his teens , and he borrowed both guitar riffs and showmanship techniques from the blues musician t-bone walker .
berry thought his blues music would be of more interest to chess , but to his surprise it was a traditional country fiddle tune , `` ida red '' , as recorded by bob wills , that got chess 's attention .
chess had seen the rhythm and blues market shrink and was looking to move beyond it , and he thought berry might be the artist for that purpose .
`` maybellene '' sold over a million copies , reaching number one on billboard magazine 's rhythm and blues chart and number five on its best sellers in stores chart for september 10 , 1955 .
berry said , `` it came out at the right time when afro-american music was spilling over into the mainstream pop .
perkins said that `` i knew when i first heard chuck that he 'd been affected by country music .
`` as they toured , perkins discovered that berry not only liked country music but also knew about as many songs as he did .
he was a guest on abc 's guy mitchell show , singing his hit song `` rock 'n ' roll music '' .
the track became his only number-one single .
allmusic said that in this period his `` live performances became increasingly erratic , ... working with terrible backup bands and turning in sloppy , out-of-tune performances '' which `` tarnished his reputation with younger fans and oldtimers '' alike .
among the many bandleaders performing a backup role with berry in the 1970s were bruce springsteen and steve miller when each was just starting his career .
=== 19802017 : last years on the road === berry continued to play 70 to 100 one-nighters per year in the 1980s , still traveling solo and requiring a local band to back him at each stop .
gene simmons of kiss gave an impromptu , unadvertised eulogy at the service , while little richard was scheduled to lead the funeral procession but did not show up due to an illness .
`` berry contributed three things to rock music : an irresistible swagger , a focus on the guitar riff as the primary melodic element and an emphasis on songwriting as storytelling .
his records are a rich storehouse of the essential lyrical , showmanship and musical components of rock and roll .
`` ) the rock critic robert christgau considers berry `` the greatest of the rock and rollers '' , while john lennon said , `` if you tried to give rock and roll another name , you might call it 'chuck berry ' .
`` ted nugent said , `` if you do n't know every chuck berry lick , you ca n't play rock guitar .
`` bob dylan called berry `` the shakespeare of rock 'n ' roll '' .
springsteen tweeted , `` chuck berry was rock 's greatest practitioner , guitarist , and the greatest pure rock 'n ' roll writer who ever lived .
the journalist chuck klosterman has argued that in 300 years berry will still be remembered as the rock musician who most closely captured the essence of rock and roll .
2324 , april 20 , 2017 ) kevin strait , curator of the national museum of african american history and culture in washington , dc , said that berry is `` one of the primary sonic architects of rock and roll .
`` yes , chuck berry invented rock 'n ' roll  and singer-songwriters .
after releasing two albums with the band , numan released his debut solo album the pleasure principle in 1979 .
his signature sound consists of heavy synthesizer hooks fed through guitar effects pedals , and he is considered a pioneer of commercial electronic music .
numan is also known for his distinctive voice and androgynous `` android '' persona .
the pleasure principle was a rock album with no guitars ; instead , numan used synthesizers fed through guitar effects pedals to achieve a distorted , phased , metallic tone .
the album featured several distinguished guest players ; mick karn ( bass , saxophone ) and rob dean ( guitar ) of japan , roger mason ( keyboards ) of models , and roger taylor ( drums ) of queen .
however , numan 's career had begun to experience a gradual decline , and he was eclipsed initially by acts such as adam ant , and later by the human league , duran duran , and depeche mode .
12 , produced two hit singles including the top 20 title track and , like i , assassin , spent six weeks in the charts .
the album was also accompanied by a new blue-and-white visual image ( including numan himself with blue hair ) , a tour , a live album/video/ep , and the title track reached the uk top 40 when released as a single .
=== 1990s === in 1991 , numan ventured into film-scoring by co-composing the music for the unborn with michael r. smith ( the score was later released as an instrumental album in 1995 , human ) .
by 1994 , numan decided to stop attempting to crack the pop market and concentrate instead on exploring more personal themes , including his vocal atheism .
numan re-evaluated his career and veered toward a harsher , more industrial direction with his songwriting on the album sacrificefor the first time he played almost all the instruments himself .
the move was critically well-received , as numan 's harder and darker sound emerged just as numan-influenced bands like nine inch nails were enjoying their first rush of fame .
in 2000 , dj armand van helden sampled the track and mixed it up in his single `` koochy '' which conquered the dancefloors .
in 2002 , uk pop trio sugababes scored a no .
rico also worked on the remix album hybrid which featured reworkings of older songs in a more contemporary industrial style as well as new material .
2003 also saw numan performing the vocals on a track named `` pray for you '' on the plump djs album eargasm .
numan lent his vocals to the track `` my machines '' on battles 's 2011 album gloss drop .
in june 2014 , numan collaborated with jayce lewis and his protafield project on the track `` redesign '' featured on protafield 's nemesis album .
his best known works include the theme to the pink panther film series ( `` the pink panther theme '' ) , `` moon river '' to breakfast at tiffany 's , and the theme to the peter gunn television series .
the peter gunn theme won the first grammy award for album of the year .
mancini 's father , quinto ( born march 13 , 1893 , scanno , italy ) was a steelworker , who made his only child begin piccolo lessons at the age of eight .
when mancini was 12 years old , he began piano lessons .
mancini 's score for the alfred hitchcock film frenzy ( 1972 ) in bachian organ andante , for organ and an orchestra of strings was rejected and replaced by ron goodwin 's work .
mancini also composed the `` viewer mail '' theme for late night with david letterman .
mancini composed the theme for nbc nightly news used beginning in 1975 , and a different theme by him , titled salute to the president was used by nbc news for its election coverage ( including primaries and conventions ) from 1976 to 1992 .
salute to the president was only published in a school-band arrangement , although mancini performed it frequently with symphony orchestras on his concert tours .
mancini recorded over 90 albums , in styles ranging from big band to light classical to pop .
mancini was also a concert performer , conducting over fifty engagements per year , resulting in over 600 symphony performances during his lifetime .
he also toured several times with johnny mathis and also with andy williams , who had each sung many of mancini 's songs ; mathis and mancini collaborated on the 1986 album the hollywood musicals .
in 1987 he conducted an impromptu charity concert in london in aid of children in need .
mancini voiced the character al , who speaks with a melancholy drawl and hates the sound of his own voice , in the episode `` guess who 's coming to breakfast ?
mancini also had an uncredited performance as a pianist in the 1967 movie gunn , the movie version of the series peter gunn , the score of which was composed by mancini .
in the 1966 pink panther cartoon pink , plunk , plink , the panther commandeered an orchestra and proceeded to conduct mancini 's theme for the series .
mancini also made a brief appearance in the title sequence of 1993 's son of the pink panther , allowing the panther to conduct bobby mcferrin in performing the film 's theme tune .
the program includes dance , voice , musical theater , and instrumental lessons .
39 on their list of the greatest songs and his score for the pink panther no .
== discography == === hit singles === === albums === === soundtracks === note : most of mancini 's scores were not released on lp soundtrack albums .
his tv movie music albums were not soundtrack albums but are titled `` music from ... '' or `` music from the motion picture ... '' he routinely retained the rights to his music .
mancini 's contracts allowed him to release his own albums for which he rearranged the score music into arrangements more appropriate for listening outside of the context of the film/theater .
actual film scores using players from hollywood unions recording under major motion picture studio contracts were expensive to release on lp ( ex : the soundtrack for 'our man flint ' ( not a mancini score ) cost $ 1 more than other lp albums of the day ) .
many soundtrack albums used to claim `` original soundtrack '' or words to that effect , but were not necessarily the actual soundtrack recordings .
these albums were usually recorded with a smaller orchestra than that used for the actual scoring ( ex : dimitri tiomkin 's score to 'the alamo ' ) .
however , many hollywood musicians were featured on mancini 's albums recorded in rca 's hollywood recording studios and faux `` original soundtrack '' albums .
his composition `` jelly roll blues '' , published in 1915 , was the first published jazz composition .
however , the scholar katy martin has argued that morton 's bragging was exaggerated by alan lomax in his book mister jelly roll , and this portrayal has influenced public opinion and scholarship on morton since .
=== career === at the age of fourteen , morton began working as a piano player in a brothel ( or , as it was referred to then , a sporting house ) .
he got to chicago in 1910 and new york city in 1911 , where future stride greats james p. johnson and willie `` the lion '' smith caught his act , years before the blues were widely played in the north .
in 1915 , his `` jelly roll blues '' was arguably the first jazz composition ever published , recording as sheet music the new orleans traditions that had been jealously guarded by musicians .
in 1917 , he followed the bandleader william manuel johnson and johnson 's sister anita gonzalez to california , where morton 's tango , `` the crave '' , was a sensation in hollywood .
=== chicago === morton returned to chicago in 1923 to claim authorship of his recently published rag , `` the wolverines '' , which had become a hit as `` wolverine blues '' in that city .
he released the first of his commercial recordings , first as piano rolls , then on record , both as a piano soloist and with various jazz bands .
his piano solos and trio recordings are well regarded , but his band recordings suffer in comparison with the chicago sides , for which morton could draw on many great new orleans musicians as sidemen .
in 1935 , morton 's 30-year-old composition `` king porter stomp '' , as arranged by fletcher henderson , became benny goodman 's first hit and a swing standard , but morton received no royalties from its recordings .
the sessions , originally intended to be a short interview with musical examples for use by music researchers in the library of congress , expanded to more than eight hours of morton talking and playing piano .
) == piano style == morton 's piano style was formed from early secondary ragtime and `` shout '' , which also evolved separately into the new york school of stride piano .
morton 's playing was also close to barrelhouse , which produced boogie-woogie .
he played basic swing rhythms with both the left and the right hand .
several of morton 's compositions were musical tributes to himself , including `` winin ' boy '' , `` the jelly roll blues '' ( subtitled `` the original jelly-roll '' ) ; and `` mr. jelly lord '' .
in the big-band era , his `` king porter stomp '' , which morton had written decades earlier , was a big hit for fletcher henderson and benny goodman ; it became a standard covered by most other swing bands of that time .
`` sweet peter '' , which morton recorded in 1926 , appears to be the source of the melody of the hit song `` all of me , '' which was credited to gerald marks and seymour simons in 1931 .
morton appears as the piano `` professor '' in louis malle 's pretty baby , where he is portrayed by the actor antonio fargas , with piano and vocals by james booker .
morton is featured in alessandro baricco 's book novecento .
he is the `` inventor of jazz '' and the protagonist 's rival throughout the book .
this book was adapted as a movie , the legend of 1900 , directed by giuseppe tornatore , in which morton is played by clarence williams iii .
albert first considered becoming a minister but instead turned to the study of mathematics and physics and received his ph.d. degree at stanford university in 1950 .
== music career == the opening line of baez 's memoir and a voice to sing with is `` i was born gifted '' ( referencing her singing voice , which she explained was given to her and for which she can take no credit ) .
baez later met bob gibson and odetta , who were at the time two of the most prominent vocalists singing folk and gospel music .
the performance generated substantial praise for the `` barefoot madonna '' with the otherworldly voice , and it was this appearance that led to baez signing with vanguard records the following year although columbia records tried to sign her first .
baez 's nickname at the time , `` madonna '' , has been attributed to her clear voice , long hair , and natural beauty , and to her role as `` earth mother '' .
the collection of traditional folk ballads , blues , and laments sung to her own guitar accompaniment sold moderately well .
robert shelton , folk critic of the new york times , praised the concert , saying , `` that superb soprano voice , as lustrous and rich as old gold , flowed purely all evening with a wondrous ease .
her singing ( unwound ) like a spool of satin .
2 contained strictly traditional material .
baez added other instruments to her recordings on farewell , angelina ( 1965 ) , which features several dylan songs interspersed with more traditional fare .
nol was a christmas album of traditional material , while baptism was akin to a concept album , featuring baez reading and singing poems written by celebrated poets such as james joyce , federico garca lorca , and walt whitman .
joan featured interpretations of work by then-contemporary composers , including john lennon and paul mccartney , tim hardin , paul simon , and donovan .
she was one of the first musicians to use her popularity as a vehicle for social protest , singing and marching for human rights and peace .
of her fourteen vanguard albums , thirteen made the top 100 of billboard 's mainstream pop chart , eleven made the top forty , eight made the top twenty , and four made the top ten .
she delivered them one last success with the gold-selling album blessed are ... ( 1971 ) which included a top-ten hit in `` the night they drove old dixie down '' , her cover of the band 's signature song .
half spoken word poem and half tape-recorded sounds , the song documented baez 's visit to hanoi , north vietnam , in december 1972 during which she and her traveling companions survived the 11-day-long christmas bombings campaign over hanoi and haiphong .
flirting with mainstream pop music as well as writing her own songs for diamonds & rust ( 1975 ) , the album became the highest selling of baez 's career and included a second top-ten single in the form of the title track .
then , on january 13 , 2006 , baez performed at the funeral of lou rawls , where she led jesse jackson , sr. , wonder , and others in the singing of `` amazing grace '' .
on june 6 , 2006 , baez joined bruce springsteen on stage at his san francisco concert , where the two performed the rolling anthem `` pay me my money down '' .
she also joined the choir in the finale of `` o holy night '' .
in addition , baez recorded a duet of `` jim crow '' with john mellencamp which appears on his album freedom 's road ( 2007 ) .
he has called the album a `` woody guthrie rock album '' .
during the concert 's finale , she spontaneously danced on stage with a band of african percussionists .
a dvd and cd of the soundtrack were released at the same time .
it is the most detailed report of her life through 1966 and outlined her anti-war position , dedicating the book to men facing imprisonment for resisting the draft .
because many of the south central farmers are immigrants from central america , baez sang several songs from her 1974 spanish-language album , gracias a la vida , including the title track and `` no nos movern '' ( `` we shall not be moved '' ) .
if he had taken his brilliance , his eloquence , his toughness and not run for office he could have led a movement .
she performed at the white house on february 10 , 2010 , as part of an evening celebrating the music associated with the civil rights movement , performing `` we shall overcome '' .
her three-song set included `` joe hill '' , a cover of the rolling stones ' `` salt of the earth '' and her own composition `` where 's my apple pie ?
the two performed the dylan composition `` with god on our side '' , a performance that set the stage for many more duets like it in the months and years to come .
in `` to bobby '' , written in 1972 , she urged dylan to return to political activism , while in `` diamonds & rust '' , the title track from her 1975 album , she revisited her feelings for him in warm , yet direct terms .
capp had this character singing bizarre songs such as `` a tale of bagels and bacon '' and `` molotov cocktails for two '' .
== history == comic characters had been a part of opera until the early 18th century , when `` opera buffa '' began to emerge as a separate genre , an early precursor having been the operatic comedy , il trespolo tutore , by alessandro stradella , in 1679 .
opera buffa was a parallel development to opera seria and arose in reaction to the so-called first reform of zeno and metastasio .
whereas opera seria was an entertainment that was both made for and depicted kings and nobility , opera buffa was made for and depicted common people with more common problems .
in the early 18th century , comic operas often appeared as short , one-act interludes known as intermezzi that were performed in between acts of opera seria .
these gave way to the full-fledged opera buffa later in the 18th century .
apart from pergolesi , the first major composers of opera buffa were nicola logroscino , baldassare galuppi and alessandro scarlatti , all of them based in naples or venice .
the opera buffa 's importance diminished during the romantic period .
another example of romantic opera buffa would be donizetti 's l'elisir d'amore of 1832 .
== relation to and differences from opera seria == while opera seria deals with gods and ancient heroes and only occasionally contained comic scenes , opera buffa involves the predominant use of comic scenes , characters , and plot lines in a contemporary setting .
the traditional model for opera seria had three acts , dealt with serious subjects in mythical settings , as stated above , and used high voices ( both sopranos and castrati ) for principal characters , often even for monarchs .
in contrast , the model that generally held for opera buffa was having two acts ( as , for example , the barber of seville ) , presenting comic scenes and situations as earlier stated and using the lower male voices to the exclusion of the castrati .
hunter , mary ( 1999 ) , the culture of opera buffa in mozart 's vienna : a poetics of entertainment .
most researchers acknowledge that the credit for creating the operetta form should go to herv ( 18251892 ) , a singer , composer , librettist , conductor , and scene painter .
=== offenbach === jacques offenbach further developed and popularized operetta , giving it its enormous vogue during the second empire and afterwards .
offenbach 's earliest one-act pieces included les deux aveugles , le violoneux and ba-ta-clan ( all 1855 ) , and his first full-length operetta success was orphe aux enfers ( 1858 ) .
what characterizes offenbach 's operettas is both the grotesque way they portray life , and the extremely frivolous way this is done , often bordering on the pornographic .
mile zola describes the back-stage and on-stage situation in the thtre des varits during the second empire in his novel nana , which takes place in late 1860s and describes the career of operetta diva/courtesan nana .
considering how zola 's nana describes an offenbach-style operetta performance in paris , it is not surprising that the mostly male , upper-class audience crowded the various theaters every evening .
the highly erotic way offenbach 's operettas were originally played , with stars like hortense schneider created a scandalized reaction from certain parts of the general public .
indeed , together with its grotesque qualities , frivolity is one of the defining elements of `` authentic '' operetta  la offenbach and herv .
it was only later , when audiences widened and became more middle and lower class , that operetta became more `` serious '' and `` nostalgic '' .
== operetta in german == === austria-hungary === the most significant composer of operetta in the german language was the austrian johann strauss ii ( 18251899 ) .
his first operetta was indigo und die vierzig ruber ( 1871 ) .
his third operetta , die fledermaus ( 1874 ) , became the most performed operetta in the world , and remains his most popular stage work .
in all , strauss wrote 16 operettas and one opera , most with great success when first premiered .
many of his lesser operettas are now largely forgotten , since his later librettists were less talented and he often composed independently of the plot .
strauss 's operettas , waltzes , polkas , and marches often have a strongly viennese style , and his popularity causes many to think of him as the national composer of austria .
franz von supp , a contemporary of strauss , closely modeled his operettas after offenbach .
=== germany === in the same way that vienna was the center of austrian operetta , berlin was the center of german operetta .
berlin operettas also sometimes included aspects of burlesque , revue , farce , or cabaret .
paul lincke pioneered the berlin operetta in 1899 with frau luna , which includes `` berliner luft '' ( `` berlin air '' ) , which became the unofficial anthem of berlin .
much later , in the 1920s and 1930s , kurt weill took a more extreme form of the berlin operetta style and used it in his operas , operettas , and musicals .
the berlin-style operetta coexisted with more bourgeois , charming , home-loving , and nationalistic german operettassome of which were called volksoperetten ( folk operettas ) .
these bucolic , nostalgic , home-loving operettas were officially preferred over berlin-style operettas after 1933 , when the nazis came to power and instituted the reichsmusikkammer ( state music institute ) , which deprecated and banned `` decadent '' music like jazz and similar `` foreign '' musical forms .
notable german operetta composers include paul lincke , eduard knneke , walter kollo , jean gilbert , leon jessel , rudolf dellinger , walter goetze and ludwig schmidseder .
== operetta in english == english-language operettas were first composed in england by the 1860s , for example , arthur sullivan 's cox and box ( 1866 ) .
sullivan and gilbert and their producer richard d'oyly carte themselves call their joint works comic operas to distinguish this family-friendly fare from the risqu french operettas of the 1850s and 1860s .
english operetta continued into the 1890s , with works by composers such as edward german , ivan caryll and sidney jones .
beginning in 1907 , with the merry widow , many of the viennese operettas were adapted very successfully for the english stage .
american operetta composers included victor herbert , whose works at the beginning of the 20th century were influenced by both viennese operetta and gilbert and sullivan .
more modern american operettas include leonard bernstein 's candide .
nevertheless , american operetta largely gave way , by the end of world war i , to musicals , such as the princess theatre musicals , and revues , followed by the musicals of rodgers and hart , cole porter , irving berlin and others .
likewise , some of leonard bernstein 's works he designated as operas ( e.g.
, trouble in tahiti ) are categorized as operettas , and his operetta candide is sometimes considered a musical .
while an opera 's story is usually believable and more relatable to its audience , an operetta aims to simply amuse .
topical satire is a feature common to many operettas .
normally some of the libretto of an operetta is spoken rather than sung .
aria , recitative , chorusare interspersed with periods of dialogue .
there is usually no musical accompaniment to the dialogue , although sometimes some musical themes are played quietly under it .
short passages of recitative are , however , sometimes used in operetta , especially as an introduction to a song .
=== operettas and musicals === the operetta is a precursor of the modern musical theatre or the `` musical '' .
in the early decades of the 20th century , the operetta continued to exist alongside the newer musical , with each influencing the other .
the main difference between the two genres is that most operettas can be described as light operas with acting , whereas most musicals are plays with singing and dancing .
an operetta 's cast will normally consist of classically trained opera singers .
these distinctions can be blurred : ezio pinza and other opera singers have appeared on broadway .
there are features of operetta in kern and hammerstein 's show boat ( 1927 ) , among others .
the characters in a musical may be more complex than those in an operetta , given the generally larger amount of dialogue .

the word `` rave '' was first used in the late 1980s to describe the culture that started at many midlands universities including : wolverhampton , coventry and de montfort university movement .
== history == === origin of 'rave ' ( 1950s1970s ) === in the late 1950s in london the term `` rave '' was used to describe the `` wild bohemian parties '' of the soho beatnik set .
the event featured the only known public airing of an experimental sound collage created for the occasion by paul mccartney of the beatles  the legendary carnival of light recording .
with the rapid change of british pop culture from the mod era of 19631966 to the hippie era of 1967 and beyond , the term fell out of popular usage .
in 1977 , at the height of the disco era , a new nightclub and discothque was opened in new york city .
the club played a formative role in the growth of dj-fuelled disco music and nightclub culture .
in the late 1980s , the word `` rave '' was adopted to describe the subculture that grew out of the acid house movement .
acid house music parties were first re-branded `` rave parties '' in the media , during the summer of 1989 by genesis p-orridge ( neil andrew megson ) during a television interview ; however , the ambience of the rave was not fully formed until the early 1990s .
in the uk , in 198889 , raves were similar to football matches , in that they provided a setting for working-class unification , at a time of union movement in decline and few jobs .
) these ranged from former warehouses and industrial sites in london , to fields and country clubs in the countryside .
the landscape is an integral feature in the composition of rave , much like it is in pagan rituals .
they were originated at some point that certain moves had begun to be performed to several people at those places , creating a completely freestyle , yet still highly complex set of moves , adaptable to every dancer change and dance whatever they want based on these moves .
clothing is vibrant and alternative , often taking inspiration from new-age punk and grunge style .
the traditional rav'n lights are limited now , but many stores have developed newer , brighter , and more advanced version of lights with a plethora of colors and modesmodes include solid , stribbon , strobe , dops , hyper flash , and other variations .
however , disco dancers and ravers preferred different drugs .
whereas 1970s disco scene members preferred cocaine and the depressant/sedative quaaludes , ravers preferred mdma , 2c-b , amphetamine , morphine and other pills .
in urbanized germany raves and techno parties often preferred industrial sceneries such as decommissioned power stations , factories , the canalization or former military properties of the cold war .
across europe , rave culture was becoming part of a new youth movement .
djs and electronic-music producers such as westbam proclaimed the existence of a `` raving society '' and promoted electronic music as legitimate competition for rock and roll .
=== north america === ==== origins in disco and psychedelia ( 1970s ) ==== american ravers , following their early uk & european counterparts , have been compared to the hippies of the 1960s due to their shared interest in non-violence and psychedelia .
rave culture incorporated disco culture 's same love of dance music spun by djs , drug exploration , sexual promiscuity , and hedonism .
the key motive for remaining underground in many parts of the us had to do with curfew and the standard 2:00 am closing of clubs .
they were also the first production company to throw raves in mexico , launching the rave culture movement within south america .
however , rave and club culture remains on the whole very much a youth-driven movement in terms of its core fan base .
in late 1991 , raves started to expand across northern california , and cities like sacramento , oakland , silicon valley ( palo alto , san jose ) holding raves every weekend .
this proved to be the turning point in northern california 's rave history .
la scene promoters such as vince bannon and phil blaine held gigs for electronic acts like 808 state , aphex twin , prodigy , and massive attack .
==== recent years ( 2000s ) ==== by 2010 , raves were becoming the equivalent of large-scale rock music festivals , but many times even bigger and more profitable .
similar to the united states and britain , raves in australia were unlicensed and held in spaces normally used for industrial and manufacturing purposes , such as warehouses , factories and carpet showrooms .
throughout his childhood , he would practice his singing and playing along with his brother garnet , six years his junior .
the airliner was flying from dallas , texas to toronto and montreal when an in-flight fire forced it to make an emergency landing at the greater cincinnati airport in northern kentucky .
stan 's son , nathan rogers , is also an established canadian folk artist with a voice and lyrical acumen similar to his father 's .
he has released two critically acclaimed solo discs and tours internationally as a solo act and in the trio dry bones .
in 2013 , groundwood books turned rogers ' song northwest passage into a children 's book illustrated by award-winning artist matt james .
the beatles were an english rock band formed in liverpool in 1960 .
with members john lennon , paul mccartney , george harrison and ringo starr , they became widely regarded as the foremost and most influential act of the rock era .
rooted in skiffle , beat and 1950s rock and roll , the beatles later experimented with several musical styles , ranging from pop ballads and indian music to psychedelia and hard rock , often incorporating classical elements and unconventional recording techniques in innovative ways .
they acquired the nickname `` the fab four '' as beatlemania grew in britain the next year , and by early 1964 became international stars , leading the `` british invasion '' of the united states pop market .
fifteen-year-old paul mccartney joined as a rhythm guitarist shortly after he and lennon met that july .
the three guitarists , billing themselves at least three times as johnny and the moondogs , were playing rock and roll whenever they could find a drummer .
they used the name until may , when they became the silver beetles , before undertaking a brief tour of scotland as the backing group for pop singer and fellow liverpudlian johnny gentle .
after the beatles completed their second hamburg residency , they enjoyed increasing popularity in liverpool with the growing merseybeat movement .
martin immediately complained to epstein about best 's poor drumming and suggested they use a session drummer in his place .
martin initially selected the starr version of `` love me do '' for the band 's first single , though subsequent re-pressings featured the white version , with starr on tambourine .
`` lennon said little thought went into composition at the time ; he and mccartney were `` just writing songs  la everly brothers ,  la buddy holly , pop songs with no more thought of them than that  to create a sound .
their commercial success brought increased media exposure , to which the beatles responded with an irreverent and comical attitude that defied the expectations of pop musicians at the time , inspiring even more interest .
with the beatles became the second album in uk chart history to sell a million copies , a figure previously reached only by the 1958 south pacific soundtrack .
vee-jay finished preparation for the album introducing ...
according to erlewine , the accompanying soundtrack album , a hard day 's night , saw them `` truly coming into their own as a band .
within a year , `` the distinctions between the folk and rock audiences would have nearly evaporated [ and the group 's ] audience ... [ was ] showing signs of growing up .
`` the soundtrack was dominated by lennon , who wrote and sang lead on most of its songs , including the two singles : `` help !
and incorporated classical instruments into some arrangements , including a string quartet on the pop ballad `` yesterday '' .
towards the end of the tour , they met with elvis presley , a foundational musical influence on the band , who invited them to his home in beverly hills .
's foray into the world of classical music with flutes and strings , harrison 's introduction of a sitar on `` norwegian wood ( this bird has flown ) '' marked a further progression outside the traditional boundaries of popular music .
as their lyrics grew more artful , fans began to study them for deeper meaning .
revolver featured sophisticated songwriting , studio experimentation , and a greatly expanded repertoire of musical styles , ranging from innovative classical string arrangements to psychedelic rock .
its creation involved eight tape decks distributed about the emi building , each staffed by an engineer or band member , who randomly varied the movement of a tape loop while martin created a composite recording by sampling the incoming data .
as chris ingham writes , they were very much `` studio creations ... and there was no way a four-piece rock 'n ' roll group could do them justice , particularly through the desensitising wall of the fans ' screams .
pepper became the catalyst for an explosion of mass enthusiasm for album-formatted rock that would revolutionise both the aesthetics and the economics of the record business in ways that far outstripped the earlier pop explosions triggered by the elvis phenomenon of 1956 and the beatlemania phenomenon of 1963 .
`` the album 's elaborate cover also attracted considerable interest and study .
a collage designed by pop artists peter blake and jann haworth , it depicted the group as the fictional band referred to in the album 's title track standing in front of a crowd of famous people .
' '' ==== magical mystery tour , the white album and yellow submarine ==== magical mystery tour , the soundtrack to a forthcoming beatles television film , was released in the uk as a six-track double extended play disc ( ep ) in early december 1967 .
in its first three weeks , the album set a record for the highest initial sales of any capitol lp , and it is the only capitol compilation later to be adopted in the band 's official canon of studio albums .
it would be seven months , however , before its soundtrack album appeared .
describing the double album , lennon later said : `` every track is an individual track ; there is n't any beatle music on it .
pepper , which had helped to establish an entire genre of literate rock criticism , the white album inspired no critical writing of any note .
==== abbey road , let it be and break-up ==== although let it be was the beatles ' final album release , it was largely recorded before abbey road .
`` lennon described the largely impromptu sessions as `` hell ... the most miserable ... on earth '' , and harrison , `` the low of all-time '' .
in an effort to alleviate tensions within the band and improve the quality of their live sound , harrison invited keyboardist billy preston to participate in the last nine days of sessions .
lennon , who rejected martin 's proposed format of a `` continuously moving piece of music '' , wanted his and mccartney 's songs to occupy separate sides of the album .
on 4 july , the first solo single by a beatle was released : lennon 's `` give peace a chance '' , credited to the plastic ono band .
its second track , the ballad `` something '' , was issued as a single  the only harrison composition ever to appear as a beatles a-side .
unterberger considers it `` a fitting swan song for the group '' , containing `` some of the greatest harmonies to be heard on any rock record '' .
mccartney 's demands that the alterations to the song be reverted were ignored , and he publicly announced his departure from the band on 10 april 1970 , a week before the release of his first , self-titled solo album .
on 8 may , the spector-produced let it be was released .
the let it be documentary film followed later that month , and would win the 1970 academy award for best original song score .
=== 1970present : after the break-up === ==== 1970s ==== lennon , mccartney , harrison and starr all released solo albums in 1970 .
their solo records sometimes involved one or more of the others ; starr 's ringo ( 1973 ) was the only album to include compositions and performances by all four ex-beatles , albeit on separate songs .
the only one to feature previously unreleased material was the beatles at the hollywood bowl ( 1977 ) ; the first officially issued concert recordings by the group , it contained selections from two shows they played during their 1964 and 1965 us tours .
all this and world war ii ( 1976 ) was an unorthodox nonfiction film that combined newsreel footage with covers of beatles songs by performers ranging from elton john and keith moon to the london symphony orchestra .
unbeknownst to him , john lennon and paul mccartney were watching the live broadcast at john 's apartment at the dakota in new york at the time , which was within walking distance of the studio where the show was being shot .
except for the red and blue albums , emi deleted all its other beatles compilations  including the hollywood bowl record  from its catalogue .
in 1999 , to coincide with the re-release of the 1968 film yellow submarine , a new soundtrack compilation cd/lp , yellow submarine songtrack , was issued .
in addition to songs he composed for the group and during his solo career , the concert included a celebration of indian classical music , which had significantly influenced harrison .
in 2003 , let it be ... naked , a reconceived version of the let it be album , with mccartney supervising production , was released .
in 2010 , the official canon of thirteen beatles studio albums , past masters , and the red and blue greatest-hits albums were made available on itunes .
`` on 26 january 2014 , paul mccartney and ringo starr performed mccartney 's `` queenie eye '' in los angeles at the 56th annual grammy awards , held at the staples center in los angeles .
although their initial style was a highly original , irresistibly catchy synthesis of early american rock and roll and r & b , the beatles spent the rest of the 1960s expanding rock 's stylistic frontiers , consistently staking out new musical territory on each release .
`` ian macdonald describes mccartney as `` a natural melodist  a creator of tunes capable of existing apart from their harmony '' .
his melody lines are characterised as primarily `` vertical '' , employing wide , consonant intervals which express his `` extrovert energy and optimism '' .
`` macdonald praises harrison 's lead guitar work for the role his `` characterful lines and textural colourings '' play in supporting lennon and mccartney 's parts , and describes starr as `` the father of modern pop/rock drumming '' .
=== influences === the band 's earliest influences include elvis presley , carl perkins , little richard and chuck berry .
=== genres === originating as a skiffle group , the beatles quickly embraced 1950s rock and roll and helped pioneer the merseybeat genre , and their repertoire ultimately expanded to include a broad variety of pop music .
although the 1965 song `` yesterday '' was not the first pop record to employ orchestral strings , it marked the group 's first recorded use of classical music elements .
gould observes : `` the more traditional sound of strings allowed for a fresh appreciation of their talent as composers by listeners who were otherwise allergic to the din of drums and electric guitars .
innovation was the most striking feature of their creative evolution , according to music historian and pianist michael campbell : `` 'a day in the life ' encapsulates the art and achievement of the beatles as well as any single track can .
it highlights key features of their music : the sound imagination , the persistence of tuneful melody , and the close coordination between words and music .
it represents a new category of song  more sophisticated than pop ... and uniquely innovative .
`` philosophy professor bruce ellis benson agrees : `` the beatles ... give us a wonderful example of how such far-ranging influences as celtic music , rhythm and blues , and country and western could be put together in a new way .
martin suggested to a sceptical mccartney that the arrangement of `` yesterday '' should feature a string quartet accompaniment , thereby introducing the beatles to a `` hitherto unsuspected world of classical instrumental colour '' , in macdonald 's description .
along with innovative studio techniques such as sound effects , unconventional microphone placements , tape loops , double tracking and vari-speed recording , the beatles augmented their songs with instruments that were unconventional in rock music at the time .
the film let it be ( 1970 ) won the 1971 academy award for best original song score .
the melody-dominated homophony of the classical and romantic periods relegated the trumpet to a secondary role by most major composers owing to the limitations of the natural trumpet .
the attempt to give the trumpet more chromatic freedom in its range saw the development of the keyed trumpet , but this was a largely unsuccessful venture due to the poor quality of its sound .
when a fourth valve is present , as with some piccolo trumpets , it usually lowers the pitch a perfect fourth ( 5 semitones ) .
to overcome the problems of intonation and reduce the use of the slide , renold schilke designed the tuning-bell trumpet .
removing the usual brace between the bell and a valve body allows the use of a sliding bell ; the player may then tune the horn with the bell while leaving the slide pushed in , or nearly so , thereby improving intonation and overall response .
the smallest trumpets are referred to as piccolo trumpets .
the tubing in the b piccolo trumpet is one-half the length of that in a standard b trumpet .
many players use a smaller mouthpiece on the piccolo trumpet , which requires a different sound production technique from the b trumpet and can limit endurance .
almost all piccolo trumpets have four valves instead of the usual three  the fourth valve lowers the pitch , usually by a fourth , to assist in the playing of lower notes and to create alternate fingerings that facilitate certain trills .
maurice andr , hkan hardenberger , david mason , and wynton marsalis are some well-known trumpet players known for their additional virtuosity on the piccolo trumpet .
since many pocket trumpet models suffer from poor design as well as cheap and imprecise manufacturing , the intonation , tone color and dynamic range of such instruments are severely hindered .
the trumpet is often confused with its close relative the cornet , which has a more conical tubing shape compared to the trumpet 's more cylindrical tube .
this , along with additional bends in the cornet 's tubing , gives the cornet a slightly mellower tone , but the instruments are otherwise nearly identical .
they have the same length of tubing and , therefore , the same pitch , so music written for cornet and trumpet is interchangeable .
another relative , the flugelhorn , has tubing that is even more conical than that of the cornet , and an even richer tone .
it is sometimes augmented with a fourth valve to improve the intonation of some lower notes .
== playing == === fingering === on any modern trumpet , cornet , or flugelhorn , pressing the valves indicated by the numbers below produces the written notes shown .
alternate fingerings may be used to improve facility in certain passages , or to aid in intonation .
extending the third valve slide when using the fingerings 1-3 or 1-2-3 further lowers the pitch slightly to improve intonation .
multi-phonics : playing a note and `` humming '' a different note simultaneously .
for example , sustaining a middle c and humming a major 3rd `` e '' at the same time .
a common method book for beginners is the walter beeler 's method for the cornet , and there have been several instruction books written by virtuoso allen vizzutti .
== players == in early jazz , louis armstrong was well known for his virtuosity and his improvisations on the hot five and hot seven recordings .
this music is commonly played on modern piccolo trumpets , although there are many highly proficient performers of the original instruments .
because the overtone series does not allow stepwise movement until the upper register , the tessitura for this repertoire is very high .
anton weidinger developed in the 1790s the first successful keyed trumpet , capable of playing all the chromatic notes in its range .
in recent years , perhaps no single person did more to spread the wobbly gospel than phillips , whose countless concerts were , in effect , organizing meetings for the cause of labor , unions , anarchism , pacifism , and the wobblies .
the album includes `` enola gay , '' his first composition written about the united states ' atomic attack on hiroshima and nagasaki .
he was a gifted storyteller and monologist , and his concerts generally had an even mix of spoken word and sung content .
he wrote hundreds of political , folk , and children 's songs , along with ballads and improvised works , sometimes with a communist leaning .
during his early teens guthrie learned folk and blues songs from his parents ' friends .
during his later years , in spite of his illness , guthrie served as a figurehead in the folk movement , providing inspiration to a generation of new folk musicians , including mentoring ramblin ' jack elliott and bob dylan .
guthrie had a natural affinity for music , learning old ballads and traditional english and scottish songs from the parents of friends .
according to one story , guthrie befriended an african-american blues harmonica player named `` george '' , whom he would watch play at the man 's shoe shine booth .
during the late part of that decade , he achieved fame with radio partner maxine `` lefty lou '' crissman as a broadcast performer of commercial `` hillbilly '' music and traditional folk music .
robbin remained guthrie 's lifelong friend , and helped guthrie book benefit performances in the communist circles in southern california .
=== 1940s : building a legacy === ==== new york city ==== arriving in new york , guthrie , known as `` the oklahoma cowboy '' , was embraced by its leftist folk music community .
choreographer sophie maslow developed folksay as an elaborate mix of modern dance and ballet , which combined folk songs by woody guthrie with text from carl sandburgs 1936 book-length poem the people , yes .
woody guthrie and fellow folksinger tony kraber played guitar , sang songs , and read text from the people , yes .
the department of the interior hired him for one month to write songs about the columbia river and the construction of the federal dams for the documentary 's soundtrack .
woody routinely emphasized his working-class image , rejected songs he felt were not in the country blues vein he was familiar with , and rarely contributed to household chores .
longhi later wrote about these experiences in his book woody , cisco and me .
the book offers a rare first-hand account of guthrie during his merchant marine service .
although he regained movement in the arm , he was never able to play the guitar again .
the progression of huntington 's threw guthrie into extreme emotional states causing him to lash out at those nearby and to damage a prized book collection of anneke 's .
leventhal repeated the tribute on september 12 , 1970 , at the hollywood bowl .
though the original recordings of these songs date back more than 30 years , walker sings them in a traditional folk-revivalist manner reminiscent of guthries social conscience and sense of humor .
speaking of guthrie , walker said : `` i cant think of hardly anyone who has had as much influence on my own singing and songwriting as woody .
musicians performing over the course of the conference included arlo guthrie , bruce springsteen , billy bragg , pete seeger , ramblin ' jack elliott , the indigo girls , ellis paul , jimmy lafave , ani difranco , and others .
on july 10 , 2012 , smithsonian folkways released the woody at 100 : the woody guthrie centennial collection , a 150-page large-format book with three cds containing 57 tracks .

the term was popularized in the 1980s as a marketing category for non-western traditional music .
however , world music is not exclusively traditional folk music .
it may include cutting edge pop music styles as well .
world music may incorporate distinctive non-western scales , modes and/or musical inflections , and often features distinctive traditional ethnic instruments , such as the kora ( west african harp ) , the steel drum , the sitar or the didgeridoo .
academic study of world music , as well as the musical genres and individual artists associated with it appear in such disciplines as anthropology , folkloristics , performance studies and ethnomusicology .
this is especially true in the context of world music , where branches of ethnically influenced pop trends are as genre-defined by consumer perception as they are by the music industry forums that govern the basis for categorical distinction .
the world music genre 's gradual migration from a clear spectrum of roots music traditions to an extended list of hybrid subgenres is a good example of the motion genre boundaries can exhibit in a globalizing pop culture .
the breton musician alan stivell pioneered the connection between traditional folk music , modern rock music and world music with his 1972 album renaissance of the celtic harp .
neo-traditional welsh language music featuring a fusion of modern instruments and traditional instruments such as the pibgorn and the welsh harp has been further developed by artists such as bob delyn a'r ebillion .
lebanese musical pioneer lydia canaan fused middle-eastern quarter notes and microtones with anglophone folk , and is listed in the catalog of the rock and roll hall of fame and museum 's library and archives as the first rock star of the middle east .
experimental psychedelic rock group super furry animals 's welsh-language album mwng was released in may 2000 and re-released in may 2015 , captures the spirit of world music as 'trying to hang on to something that 's under serious threat from advanced capitalism ' .
while communication technology allows greater access to obscure forms of music , the pressures of commercialization also present the risk of increasing musical homogeneity , the blurring of regional identities , and the gradual extinction of traditional local music-making practices .
world fusion / worldbeat / ethnic fusion / global fusion can also blend specific indigenous sounds with more blatant elements of western pop .
good examples are tibetan bowls , tuvan throat singing , gregorian chant or native american flute music .
examples of ethnic fusion are nicholas gunn 's `` face-to-face '' from beyond grand canyon , featuring authentic native american flute combined with synthesizers , and `` four worlds '' from the music of the grand canyon , featuring spoken word from razor saltboy of the navajo indian nation .
=== world fusion === the subgenre world fusion is often mistakenly assumed to refer exclusively to a blending of western jazz fusion elements with world music .
although such a hybrid expression falls easily into the world fusion category , the suffix `` fusion '' in the term world fusion should not be assumed to mean only jazz fusion .
== popular non-western genres == although it primarily describes traditional music , the world music category also includes popular music from non-western urban communities ( e.g .
french pop music ) would not generally be considered world music .
this project and the work of peter gabriel and johnny clegg among others had , to some degree , introduced non-western music to a wider audience .
caribbean music in the united kingdom or chicano rock in the united states would be two obvious examples .
in the 2010s several musicians from immigrant communities in the west rose to global popularity , such as haitian-american wyclef jean , somali-canadian k'naan , tamil-briton m.i.a.
cuban-born singer-songwriter addys mercedes started of her international career from germany mixing traditional elements of son with pop .
the juno nominated orchid ensemble is a trio of two chinese instruments and the marimba ( plus other percussion instruments ) .
since the early 1980s the enthusiasm for music from 'outside ' western pop culture has been steadily mounting .
== 2010s radio programs == world music radio programs today often play african hip hop or reggae artists , crossover bhangra and latin american jazz groups , etc .
these festivals have featured artists including nusrat fateh ali khan , youssou n'dour , peter gabriel and jaojoby .
the festival features traditional music from around the world with a mystical theme , religious function and/or sacred content .
examples : lucinda williams , john doe , ojos de brujo , o-maya , ladysmith black mambazo , the funk brothers and also symphony orchestras and operatic stars .
dances and choruses were incorporated as well as solo and ensemble numbers , all to orchestral accompaniment .
the characters in these early , baroque zarzuelas were a mixture of gods , mythological creatures and rustic or pastoral comedy characters ; antonio de literes 's popular acis y galatea ( 1708 ) is yet another example .
== italian influence == in 18th-century bourbon spain , italian artistic style dominated in the arts , including italian opera .
costume dramas and regional variations abound , and the librettos ( though often based on french originals ) are rich in spanish idioms and popular jargon .
musical content from this era ranges from full-scale operatic arias ( romanzas ) through to popular songs , and dialogue from high poetic drama to lowlife comedy characters .
one popular work from the gnero nfimo years is la corte de faran ( 1910 ) , by vicente lle , which was based on the french operetta madame putiphar .
the zarzuela continued to flourish in the 1930s , thanks to composers of the stature of pablo sorozbal  who reinvigorated it as a vehicle for socio-political comment  federico moreno torroba , and francisco alonso .
vives became one of the most important zarzuela composers , with such masterpieces as doa francisquita , la villana ( both based on plays by lope de vega ) and the through-written opera in zarzuela style maruxa .
less known performers such as ana mara iriarte , ins ribadeneira , toy rosado , carlos mungua , renato cesari , and others frequently lent their voices to the recordings .
many well-known singers , including victoria de los angeles and montserrat caball , have recorded albums of zarzuela songs and arias .
she was recorded on the avenue habib bourguiba singing `` kelmti horra '' to protesters and it became a viral video .
the album was influenced by joan baez , massive attack , and bjrk .
producers of the album include the former bjrk collaborator , icelandic producer valgeir sigursson and her main collaborator french/tunisian producer amine metani .
the first single off the album , `` ensen dhaif '' ( human , helpless human ) , was named as `` best new track '' by pitchfork on february 16 , 2016 .
her other musical influences include janis joplin , sinad oconnor , led zeppelin , james blake , susanne sundfr , bob dylan , roger waters and fuck buttons .
the ramones were an american punk rock band that formed in the new york city neighborhood of forest hills , queens , in 1974 .
despite achieving only limited commercial success , the band was a major influence on the 1970s punk movement in both the united states and united kingdom .
they became friends with douglas colvin , who had recently moved to the area from germany , and jeffrey hyman , who was the initial lead singer of the glam rock band sniper , founded in 1972 .
he was inspired by paul mccartney 's use of the pseudonym paul ramon during his silver beetles days .
dee dee would continue , however , to count off each song 's tempo with his signature rapid-fire shout of `` 1-2-3-4 !
by this time , the ramones were recognized as leaders of the new scene that was increasingly being referred to as `` punk '' .
`` === spearheading punk : 19761977 === the ramones recorded their debut album , ramones , in april 1976 .
the ramones ' debut lp was greeted by rock critics with glowing reviews .
in rolling stone , paul nelson described it as `` constructed almost entirely of rhythm tracks of an exhilarating intensity rock & roll has not experienced since its earliest days .
`` newsday 's wayne robbins simply anointed the ramones as `` the best young rock 'n ' roll band in the known universe .
at the band 's first major performance outside of new york , a june date in youngstown , ohio , members of cleveland punk legends frankenstein aka the dead boys were present and struck up a friendship with the band .
their roundhouse appearance and a club date the following nightwhere the band met members of the sex pistols and the clashhelped galvanize the burgeoning uk punk rock scene .
the flamin ' groovies/ramones double bill was successfully reprised at the roxy theatre in los angeles the following month , fueling the punk scene there as well .
the ramones were becoming an increasingly popular live acta toronto performance in september energized yet another growing punk scene .
leave home met with even less chart success than ramones , though it did include `` pinhead '' , which became one of the band 's signature songs with its chanted refrain of `` gabba gabba hey !
in rolling stone , critic dave marsh called it `` the best american rock & roll of the year '' .
=== recordings turn more pop : 19781983 === tommy , tired of touring , left the band in early 1978 .
his position as drummer was filled by marc bell , who had been a member of the early 1970s hard rock band dust , wayne county and the backstreet boys , and the pioneering punk group richard hell & the voidoids .
the album , co-produced by tommy with ed stasium , included some new sounds such as acoustic guitar , several ballads , and the band 's first two recorded songs longer than three minutes .
though it was to be the highest-charting album in the band 's historyreaching number 44 in the united states and number 14 in great britainjohnny made clear that he favored the band 's more aggressive punk material : `` end of the century was just watered-down ramones .
`` this stance was also conveyed by the title and track selection of the compilation album johnny later oversaw , loud , fast ramones : their toughest hits .
it continued the trend established by end of the century , taking the band further from the raw punk sound of its early records .
as described by trouser press , the album , produced by graham gouldman of uk pop act 10cc , moved the ramones `` away from their pioneering minimalism into heavy metal territory '' .
according to trouser press , it brought the band `` back to where they once belonged : junky '60s pop adjusted for current tastes '' , which among other things meant `` easing off the breakneck rhythm that was once ramones dogma .
in the past , it was always just me singing for the most part .
`` richie 's composition , `` somebody put something in my drink '' , remained a staple in the ramones set list until their last show in 1996 and was included in the album loud , fast ramones : their toughest hits .
the eight song bonus disc , the ramones smash you : live '85 , is also named after richie 's composition `` smash you '' .
produced by jean beauvoir , formerly a member of the plasmatics , the album was characterized by a rolling stone reviewer as `` nonstop primal fuzz pop '' .
he was fired after two performances ( august 28 & 29 , 1987 ) because his drumming could not keep up with the rest of the band .
he quickly returned to punk rock and formed several bands , in much the same vein as the ramones , for whom he also continued to write songs .
in 1993 , the ramones were featured in the animated television series the simpsons , providing music and voices for animated versions of themselves in the episode `` rosebud '' .
after the lollapalooza tour 's conclusion , the ramones played their final show on august 6 , 1996 , at the palace in hollywood .
in addition to a reappearance by dee dee , the show featured several guests including motrhead 's lemmy , pearl jam 's eddie vedder , soundgarden 's chris cornell , numskull 's ralph foster and rancid 's tim armstrong and lars frederiksen .
green day played `` teenage lobotomy '' , `` rockaway beach '' , and `` blitzkrieg bop '' as a tribute , demonstrating the ramones ' continuing influence on later rock musicians .
the ceremony was one of dee dee 's last public appearances ; on june 5 , 2002 , two months later , he was found at his hollywood home , dead from a heroin overdose .
they also drew on the harder rock sound of the mc5 , black sabbath , the stooges and the new york dolls , now known as seminal protopunk bands .
the ramones ' style was in part a reaction against the heavily produced , often bombastic music that dominated the pop charts in the 1970s .
`` in 1974 everything was tenth-generation elton john , or overproduced , or just junk .
`` ira robbins and scott isler of trouser press describe the result : with just four chords and one manic tempo , new york 's ramones blasted open the clogged arteries of mid-'70s rock , reanimating the music .
their genius was to recapture the short/simple aesthetic from which pop had strayed , adding a caustic sense of trash-culture humor and minimalist rhythm guitar sound .
as leaders in the punk rock scene , the ramones ' music has usually been identified with that label , while some have defined their characteristic style more specifically as pop punk and others as power pop .
in the 1980s , the band sometimes veered into hardcore punk territory , as can be heard on too tough to die .
this fashion emphasized minimalism , which was a powerful influence on the new york punk scene of the 1970s and reflected the band 's short , simple songs .
music historian jon savage writes of their debut album that `` it remains one of the few records that changed pop forever .
`` as described by allmusic critic stephen thomas erlewine , `` the band 's first four albums set the blueprint for punk , especially american punk and hardcore , for the next two decades .
`` trouser press 's robbins and isler similarly wrote that the ramones `` not only spearheaded the original new wave/punk movement , but also drew the blueprint for subsequent hardcore punk bands '' .
punk journalist phil strongman writes , `` in purely musical terms , the ramones , in attempting to re-create the excitement of pre-dolby rock , were to cast a huge shadowthey had fused a blueprint for much of the indie future .
`` the ramones ' two july 1976 shows , like their debut album , are seen as having a significant impact on the style of many of the newly formed british punk actsas one observer put it , `` instantly nearly every band speeded up '' .
the central fanzine of the early uk punk scene , sniffin ' glue , was named after the song `` now i wan na sniff some glue '' , which appeared on the debut lp .
canada 's first major punk scenesin toronto and in british columbia 's victoria and vancouverwere also heavily influenced by the ramones .
new jersey 's horror punk/hardcore punk band the misfits ( whose bassist jerry only was a longtime friend of the band ) were influenced by the `` blitzkrieg '' tempo of the ramones , infusing it into their already medium-fast tempo , r & b style of punk rock .
the members of motrhead later composed the song `` r.a.m.o.n.e.s .
in the realm of alternative rock , the song `` 53rd and 3rd '' lent its name to a british indie pop label cofounded by stephen pastel of the scottish band the pastels .
it means the masses did n't care .
`` kevin morby 's fourth album city music features the track `` 1234 '' inspired by the singer 's childhood love of ramones .
in 2001 , dee dee made a guest appearance on one track of ramones maniacs , a multi-artist cover of the entire ramones mania compilation album .
the song ramones the same , which came out the following year , includes performances by the dictators , who were part of the early new york punk scene , and wayne kramer , guitarist for the influential protopunk band mc5 .
motrhead 's phil campbell tells in jari-pekka laitio-ramone 's book ramones : soundtrack of our lives : `` we did a cover of rockaway beach with me on backing vocals , which was quite enjoyable .
patterned after the kingston trio , a splinter group known as the new london trio performed with guitar , upright bass , and banjo .
=== 1980s === in both 1980 and 1982 , the idlers performed at carnegie hall during eve queler 's performance of wagner 's rienzi opera .
the occasional show tune and holiday song round out the mix .
no individual voice stands out , as they work together to create a smooth and pleasing harmony .
over the years , the idlers have also performed with a squeezebox ( or concertina ) , the harmonica ( or mouth organ ) , spoons , washboard , tin whistle , and squeeze-bulb klaxon horn .
because of listener interest in the artists who do not fit as comfortably in the country or rock genres , a radio format called `` americana '' was developed by the ama and reported by r & r ( radio & records , a radio trade publication ) .
musically , the album is an compilation of pop and dance music with electronic elements ; it features appearances from three of alaska 's fellow rupaul 's drag race contestants : season four 's willam , and season six 's courtney act and laganja estranja .

among other descriptions , their performance has been likened to `` the very weirdest parts of late-'60s pink floyd pieces ( like the shrieking guitar scrapes of 'interstellar overdrive ' ) '' .
his 1963 album fantasias for guitar and banjo explores various styles and instrumentation and `` could also be accurately described as one of the very first psychedelic records '' .
later albums , such as 1968 's e pluribus unum and his live album still valentine 's day 1969 , which use experimental recording techniques and extended improvisation , also have psychedelic elements .
during the late 1960s and early 1970s , solo acts such as syd barrett and nick drake began to incorporate psychedelic influences into folk music with albums such as barrett 's the madcap laughs and drake 's five leaves left .
this was a continuation of a process by which progressive folk had considerable impact on mainstream rock .
psychedelic music emerged during the 1960s among folk and rock bands in the united states and britain , creating the subgenres of psychedelic folk , psychedelic rock ( or acid rock ) , and psychedelic pop before declining in the early 1970s .
numerous spiritual successors followed in the ensuing decades , including progressive rock , krautrock , heavy metal .
since the 1970s , revivals have included psychedelic funk , neo-psychedelia , and psychedelic hip hop , as well as psychedelic electronic genres such as acid house , trance music and new rave .
exotic instrumentation , with a particular fondness for the sitar and tabla are common .
songs often have more disjunctive song structures , key and time signature changes , modal melodies , and drones than contemporary pop music .

there was already a culture of drug use among jazz and blues musicians , and in the early 1960s use of drugs including cannabis , peyote , mescaline and lsd began to grow among folk and rock musicians .
folk artists who were particularly significant in the psychedelic movement .
psychedelic rock reached its peak in the last years of the decade .
the beatles introduced guitar feedback with `` i feel fine '' ( 1964 ) , indian instrumentation on `` norwegian wood '' ( 1965 ) and reversed tape sounds on `` rain '' ( 1966 ) .
the beach boys ' brian wilson attempted to translate the effects of lsd into music for the group 's album pet sounds ( 1966 ) , which significantly heightened the visibility of psychedelic rock .
as psychedelia emerged as a mainstream and commercial force , it would be reflected in pop music .
pet sounds is credited for sparking a psychedelic pop revolution , inspiring mainstream pop acts to take part in the psychedelic culture .
early `` acid casualties '' in the music scene , including brian wilson of the beach boys , brian jones of the rolling stones , peter green of fleetwood mac and syd barrett of pink floyd , helped to shift the focus of many rock bands away from psychedelia .
psychedelic influences lasted a little longer in pop music , stretching into the early 1970s and playing a major part in the creation of bubblegum pop .
similarly , psychedelic soul continued into the early 1970s , and its sounds were incorporated into funk music and eventually became part of the disco music style .
== revivals and successors == === rock and pop === ==== prog , krautrock , and metal ==== many of the british musicians and bands that had embraced psychedelia moved into creating the progressive rock genre in the 1970s .
king crimson 's album in the court of the crimson king ( 1969 ) , has been seen as an important link between psychedelia and progressive rock .
their adoption of electronic synthesisers , along with the musical styles explored by brian eno in his keyboard playing with roxy music , had a major influence on subsequent development of electronic rock .
the incorporation of jazz styles into the music of bands like soft machine and can , also contributed to the development of the emerging jazz rock sound of bands such as colosseum .
psychedelic rock , with its distorted guitar sound , extended solos , and adventurous compositions , was an important bridge between blues-oriented rock and the later emergence of the heavy metal genre .
two former guitarists with the yardbirds , jeff beck and jimmy page , moved on to form key acts in the new blues rock-heavy metal genre , the jeff beck group and led zeppelin , respectively .
other major pioneers of the heavy metal genre had begun as blues-based psychedelic bands , including black sabbath , deep purple , judas priest and ufo .
they `` re-discovered music that was fundamentally pop yet unafraid to revel in a quirkiness born of altered states .
`` neo-psychedelia ( or `` acid punk '' ) is a diverse style of music that originated in the 1970s as an outgrowth of the british post-punk scene .
neo-psychedelia may include forays into psychedelic pop , jangly guitar rock , heavily distorted free-form jams , or recording experiments .
a wave of british alternative rock in the early 1990s spawned the subgenres dream pop and shoegazing .
dream pop is typified by a preoccupation with atmosphere and texture as much as melody , whereas shoegazing is typified by the blurring of component musical partstypically significant guitar distortion , feedback and obscured vocalsinto indistinguishable mixture of sound .
==== hypnagogic pop , chillwave , and glo-fi ==== downtempo pop is a variety of music styles from the 2000s characterized by mellow beats , vintage synthesizers , and lo-fi melodies .
in other words , an umbrella term that includes chillwave , glo-fi , and hypnagogic pop .
in august 2009 , `` hypnagogic pop '' was coined by journalist david keenan to refer to a developing trend of 2000s lo-fi and post-noise music in which artists from varied backgrounds began to engage with elements of cultural nostalgia , childhood memory , and outdated recording technology .
the terms `` hypnagogic pop '' , `` chillwave '' , and `` glo-fi '' were soon adopted to describe the evolving sound of such artists , a number of which had songs of considerable success within independent music circles .
originally , it was common for the three terms to be used interchangeably , but chillwave later distinguished itself as a combination of dream pop , new age , muzak , and synth-pop .
`` === funk and soul === following the late 1960s work of jimi hendrix , psychedelia began to have a widespread impact on african american musicians .
black funk artists such as sly and the family stone borrowed techniques from psychedelic rock music , including wah pedals , fuzz boxes , echo chambers , and vocal distorters , as well as elements of blues rock and jazz .
influenced by the civil rights movement , psychedelic soul had a darker and more political edge than much psychedelic rock .
white rappers beastie boys double album paul 's boutique ( 1989 ) moved towards a more sophisticated sound that incorporated diverse influences , including curtis mayfield and pink floyd .
in the 1990s there was considerable experimentation and cross-fertilisation between psychedelia and rap .
dawn , an ensemble formed by brothers attrell and jarrett cordes drew on diverse samples of modern pop music from the beatles , through sly and the family stone to spandau ballet .
=== electronic === ==== house , techno , and trance ==== the rave scene emphasized house , acid house and techno .
the rave genre `` hardcore '' first appeared amongst the uk acid movement during the late 1980s at warehouse parties and other underground venues , as well as on uk pirate radio stations .
the genre then began to penetrate the british pop charts with hits for m/a/r/r/s , s'express , and technotronic by the early 1990s , before giving way to the popularity of trance music .
this was followed by releases by robert leiner , sun electric , aphex twin and most influentially the techno-trance released by the harthouse label , including the much emulated `` acperience 1 '' ( 1992 ) by duo hardfloor .
it soon began to fragment into a number of subgenres , including progressive trance , acid trance , goa trance , psychedelic trance , hard trance and uplifting trance .
==== new rave ==== in britain in the 2000s ( decade ) , the combination of indie rock with dance-punk was dubbed `` new rave '' in publicity for klaxons , and the term was picked up and applied by the nme to a number of bands .

psychedelic pop is a pop music subgenre in which musical characteristics associated with psychedelic music are applied to pop songs .
blended with pop , they create melodic songs with tight song structures .
== characteristics == according to allmusic , psychedelic pop was not too `` freaky '' , but also not very `` bubblegum '' either .
it appropriated the effects associated with straight psychedelic music , applying their innovations to concise pop songs .
`` == history == === origins === in the mid 1960s , the beach boys ' brian wilson began to experiment with psychedelic drugs , eventually resulting in the album pet sounds ( may 1966 ) , which is credited for sparking a psychedelic pop revolution .
psychedelic rock had existed before pet sounds , mainly among garage bands like the 13th floor elevators , but pet sounds inspired mainstream pop acts to take part in the psychedelic culture .
two months later , the beatles ' revolver ( august 1966 ) also ensured that psychedelic pop emerged from its underground roots and into the mainstream .
biographer ian macdonald wrote that the album `` had initiated a second pop revolution  one which while galvanising their existing rivals and inspiring many new ones , left all of them far behind '' .
journalist barney hoskyns proclaimed the beach boys ' single `` good vibrations '' ( october 1966 ) the `` ultimate psychedelic pop record '' from los angeles in its time .
popmatters added : `` its influence on the ensuing psychedelic and progressive rock movements cant be overstated ... [ it ] changed the way a pop record could be made , the way a pop record could sound , and the lyrics a pop record could have .
`` by the next year , the beatles ' single `` penny lane '' / '' strawberry fields forever '' ( february 1967 ) would become a prototype for psychedelic pop .
according to record bin 's joshua packard , the album was a `` psychedelic pop spectacle '' .

... [ the album ] has gained a well-deserved reputation for being one of the greatest pop records of the '60s .
`` === decline and revivals === by the end of the 1960s psychedelic folk and rock were in retreat .
many surviving acts moved away from psychedelia into either more back-to-basics `` roots rock '' , traditional-based , pastoral or whimsical folk , the wider experimentation of progressive rock , or riff-laden heavy rock .
psychedelic influences lasted a little longer in pop music , stretching into the early 1970s .
psychedelic pop became a component of the neo-psychedelic style .
there were occasional mainstream acts that dabbled in the genre , including prince 's mid-1980s work and some of lenny kravitz 's 1990s output , but it has mainly been the domain of alternative and indie rock bands .

psychedelic soul , sometimes called black rock , is a music genre that emerged in the late 1960s which saw soul musicians embrace elements of psychedelic rock , including its production techniques and drug influences .
it came to prominence in the late 1960s and continued into the 1970s , playing a major role in the development of funk and disco .
== history == === origins === following the lead of jimi hendrix in psychedelic rock , in the late 1960s psychedelia began to have a widespread impact on afro american musicians , particularly the stars of the motown label .
influenced by the civil rights movement , it had a darker and more political edge than much psychedelic rock .
=== decline and influence === while psychedelic rock began to waver at the end of the 1960s , psychedelic soul continued into the 1970s , peaking in popularity in the early years of the decade , and only disappearing in the late 1970s as tastes began to change .
acts like earth , wind & fire , kool & the gang , and ohio players , who began as psychedelic soul artists , incorporated its sounds into funk music and eventually the disco which partly replaced it .

later , raggare often got into fights with hippies and punks , something described in the punk rock song `` raggare is a bunch of motherfuckers '' by rude kids ( and later re-recorded by turbonegro ) .
ironically , when performing live in late 1970s and early 1980s , raggare threw rocks and tried to thrash the arenas in which uggla performed , accusing him of being a punk rocker due to his success with the more punk-oriented albums he released in the late 1970s .
eddie meduza have performed songs like `` punkjvlar '' ( `` punk bastards '' ) , or `` ragga runt , '' a tribute to the raggare subculture .

== history == the custom of singing baqashot originated in spain towards the time of the expulsion , but took on increased momentum in the kabbalistic circle in safed in the 16th century .
with the spread of safed kabbalistic doctrine , the singing of baqashot reached countries all round the mediterranean and became customary in the communities of morocco , tunisia , algeria , rhodes , greece , yugoslavia , egypt , turkey and syria .
in communities such as those of aleppo , turkey and morocco , the singing of baqashot expanded to vast proportions .
in those countries special books were compiled naming the tunes and maqamat together with the text of the hymns , in order to facilitate the singing of baqashot by the congregation .
most of the community would arise at 3:00am to sing baqashot and to listen to the voices of the hazanim , paytanim , and meshorerim .
== themes == there is a total of 66 songs in the syrian baqashot book , and the collection is now regarded as closed , unlike the general body of pizmonim , where new pizmonim are still composed for special occasions .
the songs principally consist of the praise of god , songs for shabbat , songs of longing for the holy land and so on , and include some piyyutim taken from the main body of the prayer book .
many of the songs contain acrostics identifying the author of that specific composition .
unlike the baqashot themselves , these are rendered by the hazzan or by the elder people as a mawwal ( non-rhythmical solo cadenza ) .
according to sephardic tradition , the baqashot are unique in that the melodies were composed for pre-existing texts , unlike many more recent pizmonim where the words were composed to fit an existing , often non-jewish , melody .
== current practices == the tradition of waking up before dawn and singing the baqashot still survives today in jerusalem , in the ades synagogue in nachlaot and the moussaiof synagogue in the bukharan quarter .
but there are places there still practicing this tradition like shaare sion synagogue in argentina in some settings , the honor of singing the kaddish goes to the highest bidder .

bradley joseph ( born 1965 ) is an american composer , arranger , and producer of contemporary instrumental music .
his compositions include works for orchestra , quartet , and solo piano , while his musical style ranges from `` quietly pensive mood music to a rich orchestration of classical depth and breadth '' .
he played various instruments in rock bands throughout the midwest until 1989 when greek composer yanni hired him for his core band after hearing a tape of his original compositions .
he was a featured concert keyboardist with yanni through six major tours , most recently in 2003 for the 60-city ethnicity tour .
joseph also spent five years as musical director and lead keyboardist for sheena easton , including a 1995 performance on the tonight show with jay leno .
his solo career began when he independently released hear the masses , featuring many of his yanni bandmates .
he has produced numerous cds/dvds and piano books .
he learned how to play piano from a how-to piano book he found in the piano bench .
one morning his father taught him how to play a boogie-woogie blues tune and by nightfall he could play the entire piece .
he started playing classical piano at age eight , taking lessons for a year and a half but was self-taught thereafter .
he recalls , `` i sat in the first row and when buddy 's sax player stood up to take his first solo something just clicked  the world closed in around me .
`` joseph played piano for the jazz band and choir in high school , and trombone through high school and college .
=== yanni === in 1989 , joseph recorded his first demo tape and sent it off to greek composer yanni , who was looking for someone to replace keyboardist john tesh , as tesh was launching his own solo career .
after moving to los angeles at age 23 , he composed , arranged , and performed alongside yanni for more than six years , performing in-concert with a number of notable symphony orchestras , touring throughout the u.s. and abroad as yanni gained worldwide fame .
=== sheena easton === joseph also performed with sheena easton for four years as her co-musical director and lead keyboardist .
joseph anticipated they would ask him to do a solo on at least one of the songs he was asked to play during the audition , so he wrote a solo for all three songs , which was ultimately the reason he was hired for the job .
they include charlie adams ( drums , percussion ) ; ric fierabracci ( fretless bass ) ; jeanette clinger ( vocals ) ; and grammy-winning violinist charlie bisharat .
other guest artists include larry preston ( guitar ) ; and terry brau  featured on numerous bradley joseph recordings  playing trumpet , saxophone , and fluegelhorn .
the outcome was rapture , containing intimate piano pieces , quartets , and full orchestral works .
in addition to a core band including charlie adams on percussion , charlie bisharat on violin , and steven trochlil on clarinet , joseph brought in a 50-piece orchestra , and conducted and wrote all the scores .
solo journey was released and consists of eleven soft piano compositions that are based on mood and not on melody .
`` reviewing for allmusic , jim brenholts describes one deep breath as a set of smooth adult contemporary pieces in which joseph adds `` world music flair and inspirational touches '' .
the journey continues , a sequel to solo journey , features joseph on solo piano .
the beastly aspect of this exploration is the hollywood exploitation of an almost guaranteed return on its investment with no regard for its creative progression that usually sees diminishing returns .
on these albums , joseph arranges piano , orchestra , and soft rhythms to cover melodies such as `` i 'll never fall in love again '' ( burt bacharach ) , `` fields of gold '' ( sting ) , and `` ave maria '' ( schubert ) .
it is self-described as `` piano instrumentals with a cinematic feel '' .
he received requests from listeners to do another cd with original compositions that incorporate lush orchestration along with the piano , similar to hear the masses and rapture .
yet it takes a businessperson to bring music to the masses .
joseph suggests newer artists read and study both courses and pick one that best suits their needs and wants .
when he decided to become a solo artist he wanted to be comfortable in his environment and moved back .
== composition and musical style == === on composing === in an interview with indie journal , joseph said that when writing music he prefers to concentrate on the melody first , stating , `` basically , i write from a two-person standpoint .
`` this same concept is explained again in a taped interview with the government television network with joseph explaining that a lot of times he may only come up with part of a melody .
`` in the end , a good melody will always stand the test of time '' , says joseph .
joseph explained to janus that , `` through instrumental music , i 'm allowed to come up with musical ideas that allow the listener to create their own impression of my song .
parsons goes on to say , `` the influence of years of touring with yanni is apparent in the richness of joseph 's sound , but his musical voice is his own .
joseph employs a variety of instruments to compose including the korg triton music workstation , korg sg-1 piano , and occasionally korg m1 .
`` ==== hear the masses and rapture ==== joseph 's recordings can offer full orchestrations such as in hear the masses and rapture that combine smooth jazz with contemporary instrumental themes .
`` ==== solo journey and the journey continues ==== in contrast , albums such as solo journey and the journey continues are considered to be `` stripped back and basic '' by debbage , with the latter featuring `` joseph and his piano with no additional clutter '' .
solo piano publications contributor , kathy parsons , writes , `` ... 'the long , last mile ' starts out with a bittersweet melody , and then builds in intensity and complexity with cello , winds , and ethereal sounds intertwining around the piano .
then it breaks off , and the opening melody returns .
`` for instance , the song `` dance of life '' was inspired by antonn dvok 's opera , `` rusalka '' .
it is a bit more straightforward in its piano presentation , and will probably appeal the most to hardcore fans of solo instrumental music , says instrumental weekly .
then the album closes with its title track , `` one deep breath '' , that `` floats and meanders for more than ten minutes , bringing in ocean sounds '' .
while discussing classic christmas , gerry grzyb , chairman of the university of wisconsinoshkosh sociology department , states that joseph 's usual approach is to play the carol straight , and then add his own twists .
`` ... he 's very effective at thathe does n't stray as far as a jazz or classical organ improviser might , but he does keep the interest up .
==== suites & sweets ==== joseph has also produced numerous cds that include cover arrangements for piano and orchestra .
`` ==== paint the sky ==== after requests from listeners for joseph to do another cd with original compositions that incorporate lush orchestration along with the piano , similar to hear the masses and rapture , joseph released paint the sky in april 2013 .
it is self-described as `` piano instrumentals with a cinematic feel '' .
several pieces are solo piano and others are orchestrated with keyboards to give a vibrant , cinematic effect .
`` about this album , binkelman describes the song `` inside the stars '' as `` an uptempo , joyous lead piano melody accented by bouncy rhythms played on kit drums , thumping bass , and tambourine plus superlative orchestral strings '' .
michael debagge of mainlypiano states that `` the optimism of this album is felt immediately courtesy of the buoyancy of 'inside the stars ' , filled with josephs nifty piano work more in the vein of bruce hornsby , then layered in strings and percussion work '' .
as the track progresses , the mood and style shifts into a more identifiable new age motif , with more textural synths , bell tones and bell trees , and a more pronounced sweeping sensation of subdued grandeur .
the glass-like motif returns for the songs finale .
parsons characterizes this same song as `` a concept piece that begins with an intense and intriguing theme for cello or viola and strings .
building as it evolves , it never takes a breath until near the end of the theme .
from there , the piece becomes dreamy and ambient , `` floating effortlessly '' on keyboard sounds until the original strings re-enter , increasing to the intensity of the first theme '' .
similarly , debbage states that this song brings to mind the musical opening theme of that old western television show the big valley .
in reference to the song `` secrets of the sun '' , binkelman describes `` lush strings and gorgeous new age synths with the piano melody here brimming with a blend of the ethereal and the romantic with a dash of wistfulness besides '' .
parsons details this as `` much calmer and more graceful with a piano melody and keyboard enhancements '' .
debbage writes that `` the remainder of the album is filled with josephs uncanny ability to compose elegant and emotive ballads .
`` `` the music is cinematic , filled with introspective piano solos , swelling violins , and a hypnotic song pacing that allows the listener to daydream .
ferrante & teicher were a duo of american piano players , known for their light arrangements of familiar classical pieces , movie soundtracks , and show tunes , as well as their signature style of rapid fire piano playing performances .
musical prodigies , they began performing as a piano duo while still in school .
in 1973 , they did the hollywood radio theater theme for the rod serling radio drama series , the zero hour .
the duo also experimented with prepared pianos , adding paper , sticks , rubber , wood blocks , metal bars , chains , glass , mallets , and other found objects to piano string beds .
in this way they were able to produce a variety of bizarre sounds that sometimes resembled percussion instruments , and at other times resulted in special effects that sounded as if they were electronically synthesized .
they continued to play together occasionally at a local piano store .
arthur ferrante died of natural causes on september 19 , 2009 at the age of 88 ( he had once said he wanted to live one year for each piano key ) .
madonna is considered a gay icon , and the gay community has embraced her as a pop culture icon .
`` in june 2011 , madonna urged her fans to support same-sex marriage in new york , posting the following message on her website : `` new yorkers your voices must be heard .
the label featured new and emerging young musical artists , `` triple threat '' singers who would also act and dance on the network 's series , and soundtrack and compilations based on nickelodeon tv shows .
this diversity of themes is matched by thaemlitz 's wide range of production styles , which include electroacoustic computer music , club-oriented deep house , digital jazz , ambient , and computer-composed neo-expressionist piano solos .
physical copies are no longer in print , but mp3s are available for free download ( along with a bonus track that did not fit on the original release ) .
three tracks featured on soundtrack .
a significant portion of easy listening music is purely instrumental and included some big band and orchestral arrangements of standards , themes from movies , bossa nova hits and small instrumental ensembles playing instrumental versions of popular songs , including light jazz and even some soft rock .
beautiful music was a precursor to easy listening music , had rigid standards for instrumentation , e.g.
, few or no saxophones ( at the time , the saxophone was associated with less refined styles such as jazz and rock and roll ) , and restrictions on how many vocal pieces could be played in an hour .
the easy listening radio format has been generally , but not completely , superseded by the soft adult contemporary format .
easy listening music featured popular vocalists such as frank sinatra , barbra streisand , tony bennett , dionne warwick , bill kenny , astrud gilberto , matt monro , the carpenters and many others .
in any event , these lounge singers , perhaps performing in a hotel or cocktail bar , are usually accompanied by one or two other musicians , and they favor cover songs composed by others , especially pop standards , many deriving from the days of tin pan alley .
in the early 1990s the lounge revival was in full swing and included such groups as combustible edison , love jones , the cocktails , pink martini and nightcaps .
by the 1970s , softer songs by artists like the carpenters , anne murray , john denver , barry manilow , elton john , nancy wilson and others were added to the mix on many stations .
also , some of these stations even played soft songs by artists like elvis presley , the beatles , billy joel , and other rock-based artists .
this concept was later borrowed ( and expanded upon ) by soft ac , oldies , and even some country music and hot ac stations .
the predominantly instrumental-vocal mix is still in use today , mainly by smooth jazz stations .
enka (  ) is a popular japanese music genre considered to resemble traditional japanese music stylistically .
modern enka , however , is a relatively recent musical form which arose in the context of such postwar expressions of modern japanese nonmaterial nationalism as nihonjinron , while adopting a more traditional musical style in its vocalism than rykka music , popular during the prewar years .
kobushi occurs when the pitch of the singer 's voice fluctuates irregularly within one scale degree : this compares with vibrato , which vibrates in a regular cycle .
although koga became a composer whose work is considered seminal to the creation of the genre , present-day enka is different from koga 's primary music because the singing styles of many postwar singers were different from the kobushi of koga 's musical note .
`` enka suggests a traditional , idealized , or romanticized aspect of japanese culture and attitudes .
male enka performers tend to wear formal dress , or in some performances , traditional japanese attire .
nods to traditional japanese music are common in enka .
the melodies of enka are fundamentally western harmonies , and electronic instruments are used , such as synthesizers and electric lead guitar with plenty of distortion , but its musical instruments also include traditional japanese instruments such as the shakuhachi and the shamisen .
== history == === 19th century1920s : sshi enka and violin enka === the political songs called enka in the meiji period ( 18681912 ) are also called sshi enka (  ) to distinguish it from modern enka .
`` in the taish period ( 191226 ) , enka-shi began to incorporate the violin , thus their songs were called violin enka .
when the 1995 earthquake struck , soul flower mononoke summit , a musical project of the rock band soul flower union , played sshi enka to help buoy the spirits of disaster victims .
=== late 1940s1954 : the arrival of new singers === as jazz became popular in early postwar japan , japanese singer hibari misora released her debut song `` kappa boogie-woogie '' on nippon columbia in 1949 at the age of only 12 .
=== 1960s : commercial success === in the early 1960s , rockabilly influenced by elvis presley began to gain popularity .
as enka 's traditional themes were no longer appreciated among younger japanese and western-style j-pop music became more popular , enka sales declined .
besides tv programs , enka could be heard in many restaurants , drinking establishments , karaoke bars and cafes .
taiwanese diva teresa teng was also singing in japanese and covering enka songs from the 70s until she died in 1995 at the age of 42 .
the early solo releases of then-morning musume member yuko nakazawa were also enka .
in contrast , nana mizuki , who learned enka as a child , became a voice actress and also appeared as a singer on king records in 2000 .
the song was based on `` kawachi ondo '' and featured rap .
junko akimoto released the single `` ai no mama de '' on january 23 , 2008 , reaching the top of the oricon weekly single charts in january 2009 , making her , at the age of 61 , the oldest solo singer to top the charts .
fuyumi sakamoto 's 2009 song `` asia no kaizoku '' , composed by ayumi nakamura , was an enka song featuring rock music .
sakamoto said , `` if ayumi sings the song , it 's a rock song .
10 on the oricon weekly charts , making him the first solo artist to reach the top 10 in his 70s .
because of this , many taiwanese hokkien songs are covered from japanese enka melodies , and turned into taiwanese sentimental ballads .
the creation , performance , significance , and even the definition of gospel music varies according to culture and social context .
gospel music usually has dominant vocals ( often with strong use of harmony ) with christian lyrics .
most of the singing was done a cappella .
the original gospel songs were written and composed by authors such as george f. root , philip bliss , charles h. gabriel , william howard doane , and fanny crosby .
the advent of radio in the 1920s greatly increased the audience for gospel music .
following world war ii , gospel music moved into major auditoriums , and gospel music concerts became quite elaborate .
gospel blues is a blues-based form of gospel music ( a combination of blues guitar and evangelistic lyrics ) .
southern gospel used all male , tenor-lead-baritone-bass quartet make-up .
progressive southern gospel is an american music genre that has grown out of southern gospel over the past couple of decades .
christian country music , sometimes referred to as country gospel music , is a subgenre of gospel music with a country flair .
bluegrass gospel music is rooted in american mountain music .
celtic gospel music infuses gospel music with a celtic flair , and is quite popular in countries such as ireland .
british black gospel refers to gospel music of the african diaspora , which has been produced in the uk .
some proponents of `` standard '' hymns generally dislike gospel music of the late 19th and early 20th centuries .
today , with historical distance , there is a greater acceptance of such gospel songs into official denominational hymnals .
== style == gospel music in general is characterized by dominant vocals ( often with strong use of harmony ) referencing lyrics of a christian nature .
subgenres include contemporary gospel , urban contemporary gospel ( sometimes referred to as `` black gospel '' ) , southern gospel , and modern gospel music ( now more commonly known as praise and worship music or contemporary christian music ) .
several forms of gospel music utilize choirs , use piano or hammond organ , tambourines , drums , bass guitar and , increasingly , electric guitar .
in comparison with hymns , which are generally of a statelier measure , the gospel song is expected to have a refrain and often a more syncopated rhythm .
several attempts have been made to describe the style of late 19th and early 20th century gospel songs in general .
christ-janer said `` the music was tuneful and easy to grasp ... rudimentary harmonies ... use of the chorus ... varied metric schemes ... motor rhythms were characteristic ...
the device of letting the lower parts echo rhythmically a motive announced by the sopranos became a mannerism '' .
gold said , `` essentially the gospel songs are songs of testimony , persuasion , religious exhortation , or warning .
usually the chorus or refrain technique is found .
coming out of the african american religious experience , american gospel music can be traced to the early 17th century .
repetition and `` call and response '' are accepted elements in african music , designed to achieve an altered state of consciousness we sometimes refer to as `` trance '' , and strengthen communal bonds .
most of the singing was done a cappella .
although not directly connected with african-american gospel music , they were adopted by african-americans as well as white americans , and newton 's connection with the abolition movement provided cross-fertilization .
prior to the meeting of moody and sankey in 1870 , there was an american rural/frontier history of revival and camp meeting songs , but the gospel hymn was of a different character , and it served the needs of mass revivals in the great cities .
the revival movement employed popular singers and song leaders , the most famous of them being ira d. sankey .
the original gospel songs were written and composed by authors such as george f. root , philip bliss , charles h. gabriel , william howard doane , and fanny crosby .
=== 20th century === the holiness-pentecostal movement , or sanctified movement , appealed to people who were not attuned to the europeanized version of black church music .
holiness worship has used any type of instrumentation that congregation members might bring in , from tambourines to electric guitars .
pentecostal churches readily adopted and contributed to the gospel music publications of the early 20th century .
late 20th-century musicians such as elvis presley , jerry lee lewis , mahalia jackson , andrae crouch , and the blackwood brothers either were raised in a pentecostal environment , or have acknowledged the influence of that tradition .
the advent of radio in the 1920s greatly increased the audience for gospel music , and james d. vaughan used radio as an integral part of his business model , which also included traveling quartets to publicize the gospel music books he published several times a year .
the 1920s also saw the marketing of gospel records by groups such as the carter family .
the first person to introduce the ragtime influence to gospel accompaniment as well as to play the piano on a gospel recording was arizona dranes .
in african-american music , gospel quartets developed an a cappella style following the earlier success of the fisk jubilee singers .
the gospel groups which were very popular within the black community , were virtually unknown to the white community , though some in the white community began to follow them .
in addition to these high-profile quartets , there were many black gospel musicians performing in the 1920s and 30s , usually playing the guitar and singing in the streets of southern cities .
thomas gained biblical knowledge from his father , who was a baptist minister , and was taught to play piano by his mother .
he started working with blues musicians when the family moved to atlanta .
it has been said that 1930 was the year when modern gospel music began , because the national baptist convention first publicly endorsed the music at its 1930 meeting .
meanwhile , the radio continued to develop an audience for gospel music , a fact that was commemorated in albert e. brumley 's 1937 song , `` turn your radio on '' ( which is still being published in gospel song books ) .
following the second world war , gospel music moved into major auditoriums , and gospel music concerts became quite elaborate .
in 1950 , black gospel was featured at carnegie hall when joe bostic produced the negro gospel and religious music festival .
today , black gospel and white gospel are distinct genres , with distinct audiences .
in white gospel , there is a large gospel music association and a gospel music hall of fame , which includes a few black artists , such as mahalia jackson , but which ignores most black artists .

=== backmasking === backmasking is a recording technique in which a message is recorded backwards onto a track that is meant to be played forwards .
it was popularized by the beatles , who used backward vocals and instrumentation on their 1966 album revolver .
backmasking has been a controversial topic in the united states since the 1980s , when allegations of its use for satanic purposes were made against prominent rock musicians , leading to record-burnings and proposed anti-backmasking legislation by state and federal governments .
=== phonetic reversal === certain phrases produce a different phrase when their phonemes are reverseda process known as phonetic reversal .
queen 's another one bites the dust backwards was claimed that the chorus , when played in reverse , can be heard as `` it 's fun to smoke marijuana '' or `` start to smoke marijuana '' .
it uses the melodic and main rhythmic structures of traditional akan music , but is played with western instruments .
guitar band highlife also featured singing , drums and claves .
mensah 's fame soared after he played with louis armstrong in accra in may 1956 , and he eventually earned the nickname , the `` king of highlife .
one reviewer described him as `` one of the pioneers of this raucous , rapid-fire , eight-to-the-bar piano style '' .
he began teaching himself to play the piano at the age of 15 , and by 1915 had become a noted pianist and was already influencing younger musicians , including meade lux lewis and albert ammons .
he played in a boogie-woogie style , with a strong-repeated figure in the left hand and melodic decoration in the right , but his playing was delicate and subtle rather than hard driving .
yancey favored keyssuch as e-flat and a-flatthat were atypical for barrelhouse blues .
his first recordings , in 1939 , created a considerable stir in blues and jazz circles .
he made most of his recordings solo , but later in his career he recorded with his wife , estelle yancey , singing , as jimmy and mama yancey .
2 , oldie blues , ol 2813 == legacy and influence == in 1973 the dutch composer louis andriessen premiered on jimmy yancey , a two-movement work scored for nine wind instruments , piano and double bass .
andriessen observes that yancey was not merely one of the pioneers of the boogie-woogie piano style .
in the first movement , three yancey themes are quoted ; the second is a kind of in memoriam .
both movements end with a typical boogie-woogie lick , with which yancey unexpectedly ends all his recordings .
he probably did this at a sign from the producer , when the three minutes which a 78 side could hold were up , because boogie-woogie pianists habitually played for hours on end in the bars to entertain the white bourgeoisie .
== style == klezmer is easily identifiable by its characteristic expressive melodies , reminiscent of the human voice , complete with laughing and weeping .
this is not a coincidence ; the style is meant to imitate khazone and paraliturgical singing .
various musical styles influenced traditional klezmer music .
klezmer musicians heard and adapted traditional romanian music , which is reflected in the dance forms found throughout surviving klezmer music repertoire ( e.g.
, horas , doinas , sirbas , and bulgars ) == history == the bible has several descriptions of orchestras and levites making music , but after the destruction of the second temple in 70 ce , many rabbis discouraged musical instruments .
klezmorim based much of their secular instrumental music upon the devotional vocal music of the synagogue , in particular cantorial music .
they sometimes played for christian churches and local aristocracy , and taught some italian classical violin virtuosos .
hence musicians took up the violin , tsimbl ( or cymbalom ) , and other stringed instruments .
also , a shift towards brass and percussion happened when klezmorim were conscripted into military bands .
while traditional performances may have been on the decline , many jewish composers who had mainstream success , such as leonard bernstein and aaron copland , continued to be influenced by the klezmeric idioms heard during their youth ( as gustav mahler had been ) .
some clarinet stylings of swing jazz bandleaders benny goodman and artie shaw can be interpreted as having been derived from klezmer , as can the `` freilach swing '' playing of other jewish artists of the period such as trumpeter ziggy elman .
musicians began to track down older european klezmer , by listening to recordings , finding transcriptions , and making field recordings of the few klezmorim left in eastern europe .
typically piano , accordion , or bass plays a duple oompah beat .
the name `` bulgar '' ( yiddish `` bulgarish '' ) comes from the romanian traditional song and dance ( romanian bulgareasc ) .
terkish is a 44 dance like the habanera .
terk in america is one famous arrangement by naftule brandwein , who used this form extensively .
nigun means `` melody '' in both yiddish and hebrew , a mid-paced song in 24 .
a padespan was a sort of russian/spanish waltz known to klezmers .
mazurka and polka , polish and czech dances , respectively , were often played for both jews and gentiles .
it features hopping steps and short bursts of running , accompanied by triplets in the melody .
humoresque `` halaka '' dance , a traditional israeli dance from safed in galilee ; it has an ancient melody handed down from generation to generation .
types not designed for dance are : doina is an improvisational lament usually performed solo , and is extremely important in weddings .
its basis is the romanian shepherd 's lament , so it has an expressive vocal quality , like the singing of the khazn .
often these references might occur in the form of harmonic movements or modal maneuvers that quote or otherwise invoke traditional jewish cantorial practices .
one can even hear recordings of contemporary vocalists singing the doina , including michael alpert and elizabeth schwartz .
taksim is a freeform prelude that introduces the motifs of the following piece , which is usually a freylekhs ; it was largely supplanted by the doina .
instrumental tunes often follow the types of chord progressions found in middle eastern and greek music , whereas vocal yiddish songs are often much simpler , and follow a style and chord progressions similar to russian folk songs .
they may also end with a coda , a new melodic line that is accompanied by a change in the percussion rhythm and an increase in tempo .
a typical 19th-century european orchestra included a first violin , a contra-violin ( or modified 3-stringed viola also called groyse fidl [ yid .
] ) , a tsimbl ( cimbalom or hammered dulcimer ) , a bass or cello , and sometimes a flute .
the melody is generally assigned to the lead violin , while the other instrumentalists provide harmony , rhythm , and some counterpoint ( the latter usually coming from the second violin or viola ) .
brass instrumentssuch as the french valved cornet and keyed german trumpeteventually inherited a counter-voice role .
modern klezmer instrumentation is more commonly influenced by the instruments of the 19th century military bands than the earlier orchestras .
the snare drum is the more `` authentic '' of the two .
in eastern europe , percussion was often provided by a drummer who played a frame drum , or poyk , sometimes called baraban .
they use a clarinet , saxophone , or trumpet for the melody , and make great use of the trombone for slides and other flourishes .
when a cymbalom sound is called for , a piano may be played .
for example , the typical american klezmer wedding band uses a portable electronic synthesizer , not a piano .
the compositions of israeli-born composer ofer ben-amots incorporate aspects of klezmer music , most notably his 2006 composition klezmer concerto .
the piece is for klezmer clarinet ( written for jewish clarinetist david krakauer ) , string orchestra , harp and percussion .
( this is also a feature of many rom and russian folk songs .
it is common in traditional synagogue services ( they are the beginning words of many of the psalms ) .
new romanticism ( also called blitz kids and a variety of other names ) was a pop culture movement in the united kingdom that began as a nightclub scene around 1979 and peaked around 1981 .
ultravox were also often identified as new romantics by the press although they did not exhibit the same visual styles of the movement , despite their link to the band visage .
by the end of 1981 , the original movement had largely dissipated and , although some of the artists associated with the scene continued their careers , they had largely abandoned the aesthetics of the movement .
there were attempts to revive the movement from the 1990s , including the short-lived romo movement .
== characteristics == new romanticism can be seen as a reaction to punk , and was heavily influenced by former glam rock stars of the 1970s such as david bowie and roxy music .
both sexes often dressed in counter-sexual or androgynous clothing and wore cosmetics such as eyeliner and lipstick , partly derived from earlier punk fashions .
the emergence of the new romantic movement into the mainstream coincided with vivienne westwood 's unveiling of her `` pirate collection '' , which was promoted by bow wow wow and adam and the ants , who were managed by her then partner malcolm mclaren .
the band japan also refuted any connection with the new romantic movement , having adopted an androgynous look incorporating make-up ever since their inception in the mid-1970s at the tail-end of the glam rock era , many years before the new romantic movement began .
in an interview published in january 1984 , keyboardist dave ball reflected back on their first year of success ( 1981 ) and stated `` at this time we were linked to the whole new romantics thing , but we were never a part of that .
`` while some contemporary bands , particularly those of the 2 tone ska revival , dealt with issues of unemployment and urban decay , new romantics adopted an escapist and aspirational stance .
with its interest in design , marketing and image , the movement has been seen by some as an acceptance of thatcherism and style commentator peter york even suggested that it was aligned with the new right .
== history == === origins === the new romantic movement developed almost simultaneously in london and birmingham .
the video for david bowie 's 1980 uk number one single `` ashes to ashes '' included appearances by strange with three other blitz kids and propelled the new romantic movement into the mainstream .
=== styles of music === many bands that emerged from the new romantic movement became closely associated with the use of synthesizers to create rock and pop music .
after the breakthrough of tubeway army and gary numan in the british singles chart in 1979 , large numbers of artists began to enjoy success with a synthesizer-based sound and they came to dominate the pop music of the early 1980s .
later the introduction of dance beats made the music warmer and catchier and contained within the conventions of three-minute pop .
of groups associated with the new romantic movement , culture club avoided a total reliance on synthesizers , producing a sound that combined elements of motown , the philly sound and lovers rock .
an american reaction against european synthpop and `` haircut bands '' has been seen as beginning in the mid-1980s with the rise of heartland rock and roots rock .
in the uk , the arrival of indie rock bands , particularly the smiths , has been seen as marking the end of synth-driven new wave and the beginning of the guitar rock that would come to dominate rock into the 1990s .
by the end of the 1980s many acts had been dropped by their labels and the solo careers of many artists who had been associated with the new romantic scene gradually faded .
in the same period new romanticism was also an inspiration for the short-lived romo musical movement .
it was championed by melody maker , who proclaimed on its front cover in 1995 that it was a `` future pop explosion '' that had `` executed '' britpop , and including bands orlando , plastic fantastic , minty , viva , sexus , hollywood and dex dexter .

os mutantes ( `` the mutants '' ) ( portuguese pronunciation : [ uz muttis ] ) are an influential brazilian psychedelic rock band that were linked with the tropiclia movement of the late 1960s .
=== tropiclia === through other tv performances , the band was able to meet gilberto gil , an influential musician in the tropiclia movement , who brought them into the movement 's circle .
os mutantes released two albums heavily influenced by tropiclia , which blended psychedelic rock with other forms of art .
os mutantes continued playing , but veloso stopped singing and spontaneously launched into an impassioned diatribe , denouncing the student faction for their conservatism , which provoked even louder howls of disapproval from the audience .
they released five albums together before lee departed in 1972 to start a solo career .
subsequently , the band moved in a progressive rock direction with the album o a e o z , recorded in 1973 but released only in 1992 due to disagreement with the record company .
both expressed wishes to continue with their respective solo projects .
in june 2008 , `` a minha menina '' was the featured audio track for the mcdonald 's commercial `` victory .
os mutantes is one of the most well-known and influential rock bands in brazil .
it appealed to young people who sought to modernize the traditional islamic values and attitudes .
regional , secular , and religious drum patterns , melodies , and instruments were blended with western electric instrumentation .
out of this milieu arose a group of male and female muslim singers called chioukhs and cheikhates , who rejected the refined , classical poetry of traditional algerian music .
it drew its name from the algerian arabic word ra ( opinion or advice ) , which was typically insertedand repeatedby singers to fill time as they formulated a new phrase of improvised lyrics .
`` and variations thereof .
when first developed , ra was a hybrid blend of rural and cabaret musical genres , invented by and targeted toward distillery workers , peasants who had lost their land to european settlers , and other types of lower class citizens .
the geographical location of oran allowed for the spread of many cultural influences , allowing ra musicians to absorb an assortment of musical styles such as flamenco from spain , gnawa music , and french cabaret , allowing them to combine with the rhythms typical of arab nomads .
musicians like mohammed belarbi and djelloul bendaoud added these influences to other oranian styles , as well as western piano and accordion , resulting in a style called bedoui citadinis .
meanwhile , traditional ra instruments such as the gasba ( reed flute ) , and the derbouka ( maghrebi drums ) were replaced with the violin and accordion .
this marked the beginning of pop ra , which was performed by a later generation which adopted the title of cheb ( male ) or chaba ( female ) , meaning young ,  to distinguish themselves from the older musicians who continued to perform in the original style .
this marked the beginning of pop ra , which was performed by a later generation of chabs ( young men ) and chabates ( young women ) .
previously , the algerian government had opposed ra because of its sexually and culturally risqu topics , such as alcohol and consumerism , two subjects that were taboo to the traditional islamic culture .
though ra found mainstream acceptance in algeria , islamic fundamentalists still protested the genre , saying that it was still too liberal and too contrasting to traditional islamic values .
with khaled no longer in algeria , musicians such as cheb tahar , cheb nasro , and cheb hasni began singing lover 's ra , a sentimental , pop-ballad form of ra music .
later in the decade , funk , hip hop , and other influences were added to ra , especially by performers like faudel and rachid taha , the latter of whom took ra music and fused it with rock .
taha does not call his creation ra music , but rather describes it as a combination of folk ra and punk .

rockabilly is one of the earliest styles of rock and roll music , dating back to the early 1950s in the united states , especially the south .
some have also described it as a blend of bluegrass with rock and roll .
other important influences on rockabilly include western swing , boogie woogie , jump blues , and electric blues .
== origins == there was a close relationship between blues and country music from the very earliest country recordings in the 1920s .
bob wills and his texas playboys were the leading proponents of western swing , which combined country singing and steel guitar with big band jazz influences and horn sections ; wills 's music found massive popularity .
i mean it just was n't us up there pickin ' and singing .
`` `` ... the demonstrative maddoxes , helped release white bodies from traditional motions of decorum ... more and more younger white artists began to behave on stage like the lively maddoxes .
along with country , swing and boogie influences , jump blues artists such as wynonie harris and roy brown , and electric blues acts such as howlin ' wolf , junior parker , and arthur crudup , influenced the development of rockabilly .
zeb turner 's february 1953 recording of `` jersey rock '' with its mix of musical styles , lyrics about music and dancing , and guitar solo , is another example of the mixing of musical genres in the first half of the 1950s .
many of his songs were in blues form , while others took the form of folk ballads , parlor songs , or waltzes .
later made more famous by elvis presley , perkins ' original version was an early rock 'n ' roll standard .
=== memphis === in the early 1950s there was heavy competition among memphis area bands playing an audience-savvy mix of covers , original songs , and hillbilly flavored blues .
they include : elvis presley , johnny and dorsey burnette , eddie bond , charlie feathers , jim cannon , reggie young , barbara pittman , the lazenby twins , bud deckleman , harmonica frank floyd , marcus van story , lloyd arnold , and more .
every saturday night in 1953 , the dressing rooms backstage were a gathering place where musicians would come together and experiment with new soundsmixing fast country , gospel , blues and boogie woogie .
according to burlison , `` ... when we started playing in 1951 , we played an uptempo-style country beat with gospel , blues , and a little swing mixed in .
`` they played with doc mcqueen 's swing band at the hideaway club but hated the type of music played by `` chart musicians .
the trio released `` train kept a-rollin ' '' in 1956 , listed by rolling stone magazine as one of the top 500 rock songs of all time , having been covered by the yardbirds , aerosmith , and many others .
many consider this 1956 recording to be the first intentional use of a distortion guitar on a rock song , which was played by lead guitarist paul burlison .
the use of distortion on a rock'n'roll record was more accurately `` rocket 88 '' by jackie brenston and the delta cats .
==== elvis presley ==== presley 's first recording , a blues song titled `` that 's all right mama '' , was previously recorded in 1946 by arthur crudup .
record producer sam phillips was told by country deejays that presley 's `` that 's alright mama '' was `` black music '' and lamented they would be `` run out of town '' for playing it .
`` all of presley 's early records combined a blues song on one side and a country song on the other , but both sung in the same vein .
presley 's unique musical style rocketed him into the spotlight , and drew masses of followers : `` but it 's presley 's singing , halfway between a country western and a r & b rock 'n ' roll style that has sent teenagers into a trance .
whether you like it or not , there will always be an elvis presley .
further stated by dylan : `` i thank god for elvis presley '' .
for several years , phillips had been recording and releasing performances by blues and country musicians in the area .
one young man who came to record himself as a surprise for his mother , he claimed , was elvis presley .
`` presley made enough of an impression that phillips deputized guitarist scotty moore , who then enlisted bassist bill black , both from the starlight wranglers , a local western swing band , to work with the green young elvis .
the trio rehearsed dozens of songs , from traditional country , to `` harbor lights '' , a hit for crooner bing crosby to gospel .
during a break on july 5 , 1954 , elvis `` jumped up ... and started frailin ' guitar and singin ' `` that 's all right , mama '' ( a 1946 blues song by arthur `` big boy '' crudup ) .
and many echo the sentiment that it was a sound like no other they had heard : `` when i first heard elvis singing 'that 's alright mama ' .
`` presley was now using drums , as did many other rockabilly performers ; drums were then uncommon in country music .
in 1956 elvis acquired vocal backup via the jordanaires .
=== north of the mason-dixon line === ==== bill haley ==== in 1951 a western swing bandleader named bill haley recorded a version of `` rocket 88 '' with his group , the saddlemen .
the recording was , until the late 1990s , recognized by guinness world records as having the highest sales claim for a pop vinyl recording , with an `` unaudited '' claim of 25 million copies sold .
rock 'n ' roll , an expansive term coined a couple years earlier by dj alan freed , had now been to the pop mountaintop , a position it would never quite relinquish .
==== bill flagg ==== maine native , and connecticut resident bill flagg began using the term rockabilly for his combination of rock 'n ' roll and hillbilly music as early as 1953 he cut several songs for tetra records in 1956 and 1957 .
although martin performed mostly country songs for the show , she also did songs by rhythm and blues singers ruth brown and lavern baker , as well as a few dinah washington songs .
cash hoped to record gospel music , but phillips immediately nixed that idea .
rock 'n ' roll in general , and rockabilly in particular , was at critical mass and the next year , elvis presley 's heartbreak hotel and do n't be cruel would top the billboard charts as well .
perkins 's `` blue suede shoes '' sold 20,000 records a day at one point , and it was the first million-selling country song to cross over to both rhythm and blues and pop charts .
on february 11 , presley appeared on the dorsey brothers ' stage show for the third time , singing `` blue suede shoes '' and `` heartbreak hotel .
`` within twenty-one days it sold over two hundred thousand records , stayed at the top of national pop and country charts for twenty weeks , and sold more than a million copies .
some enjoyed major chart success and were important influences on future rock musicians .
rockabilly pioneers the maddox brothers and rose , both as a group , and with rose as a solo act , added onto their two decades of performing by making records that were even more rocking .
factors contributing to this decline are usually cited as the 1959 death of buddy holly in an airplane crash ( along with ritchie valens and the big bopper ) , the induction of elvis presley into the army in 1958 , and a general change in american musical tastes .
it was the first rock n ' roll style to be performed primarily by white musicians , thus setting off a cultural revolution that is still reverberating today .
it 's easy to understand how the new york audience might have thought the burnettes were singing `` rockabilly boogie , '' but they never would , because the term hillbilly was derogatory and would never have been used by the artists themselves .
when elvis presley left phillips ' sun records and recorded `` heartbreak hotel '' for rca , the rca producers placed microphones at the end of a hallway to achieve a similar effect .
a comparison of rockabilly versions of country songs shows that while form , lyrics , chord progressions and arrangements are simplified and with sparser instrumentation , a fuller sound was achieved by more percussive playingi.e.
, subdivisions of the beat receive more emphasis .
the rockers loved 1950s rock and roll artists such as gene vincent , and some british rockabilly fans formed bands and played their own version of the music .
when john lennon first met paul mccartney , he was impressed that mccartney knew all the chords and the words to eddie cochran 's `` twenty flight rock '' .
musically , they combined holly 's melodic songwriting sensibility with the rough rock and roll sound of vincent and carl perkins .
in the 1980s , mccartney recorded a duet with carl perkins , and george harrison collaborated with roy orbison in the traveling wilburys .
beck recorded his own tribute album to gene vincent 's guitarist cliff gallupcrazy legsand page 's band , led zeppelin , offered to work as elvis presley 's backing band in the 1970s .
years later , led zeppelin 's page and robert plant recorded a tribute to the music of the 1950s called the honeydrippers : volume one .
robert gordon emerged from late 1970s cbgb punk act tuff darts to reinvent himself as a rockabilly revival solo artist .
also festering at cbgb 's punk environs were the cramps , who combined primitive and wild rockabilly sounds with lyrics inspired by old drive-in horror movies in songs like `` human fly '' and `` i was a teenage werewolf .
the polecats , from north london , were originally called the cult heroes , could n't get any gigs at rockabilly clubs with a name that sounded `` punk , '' so the original drummer chris hawkes came up with the name `` polecats .
the polecats played rockabilly with a punk sense of anarchy and helped revive the genre for a new generation in the early 1980s .
brian setzer went on to solo success working in both rockabilly and swing styles , while rocker and phantom continued to record in bands both together and singly .
shakin ' stevens was the biggest selling singles artist of the 1980s in the uk and number two across europe , outstripping michael jackson , prince , and bruce springsteen .
jason & the scorchers combined heavy metal , chuck berry , and hank williams to create a punk-influenced style of rockabilly , often labelled as alt-country or cowpunk .
these bands , like the blasters , were inspired by a full range of historic american styles : blues , country , rockabilly , r & b , and new orleans jazz .
in 1983 , neil young recorded a rockabilly album titled everybody 's rockin ' .
the album was not a commercial success and young was involved in a widely publicized legal fight with geffen records who sued him for making a record that did n't sound `` like a neil young record .
during the 1980s , a number of country music stars scored hits recording in a rockabilly style .
== neo-rockabilly ( 1990present ) == while not true rockabilly , many contemporary indie pop , blues rock , and country rock groups from the us , like kings of leon , black keys , blackfoot , and the white stripes , were heavily influenced by rockabilly .
his rockabilly style was emphasised in the singles `` pregnant for the last time '' and `` sing your life '' , as well as his second solo album and tour kill uncle .
drake bell , a pop rock singer-songwriter and actor , revived rockabilly with his 2014 album , ready steady go !
, which was produced by brian setzer , frontman of the rockabilly revival band , the stray cats .
== rockabilly hall of fame == the original rockabilly hall of fame was established by bob timmers on march 21 , 1997 , to present early rock and roll history and information relative to the original artists and personalities involved in this pioneering american music genre .

originally , the term rumba was used as a synonym for `` party '' in northern cuba , and by the late 19th century it was used to denote the complex of secular music styles known as cuban rumba .
in addition , `` rumba '' was the primary marketing term for cuban music in north america , as well as west and central africa , during much of the 20th century , before the rise of mambo , pachanga and salsa .
traditionally , the three main styles of rumba are yamb , columbia and guaguanc , each of which has a characteristic dance , rhythm and singing .
== rumba in north america == in the us , the term `` rhumba '' ( anglicised version of rumba ) , began to be used during the 1920s to refer to ballroom music with afro-cuban music themes , particularly in the context of big band music .
in the 1970s , with the emergence of salsa as a popular music and dance genre in the us , rhythmic elements of cuban rumba ( particularly guaguanc ) became prevalent alongside the son .
like salsa , rhumba would then be danced to salsa ensembles instead of big bands .
== rumba in spain == in spain , the term rumba was introduced in the early 20th century as rumba flamenca , one of the palos ( styles ) of flamenco .
particularly , it is considered one of the cantes de ida y vuelta , since flamenco itself might have had an influence on cuban rumba , particularly on its vocal style .
apart from rumba flamenca , other syncretic styles of afro-cuban origin have been named `` rumba '' throughout the iberian peninsula , outside of the context of flamenco ( where the term cantes the ida y vuelta is mostly restricted ) , such as the galician rumba .
in the late 1950s , popular artists such as peret ( el rey de la rumba ) and el pescalla developed an uptempo style that combined elements from rumba flamenca , spanish gypsy music and pop .
since the early 2000s , the term rumba has been used in spain to refer to derivatives of catalan rumba with hip hop and rock elements , as recorded by estopa , huecco and melendi .
for the tour , they were joined by peter blegvad ( ex-slapp happy , guitar , bass guitar , voice ) and marc hollander ( aksak maboul , keyboards , clarinet ) .
krause was unable to participate , so frith and cutler decided to rework the trio 's repertoire for an expanded group , with the voices of eisenberg , slipp and kihlstedt replacing krause 's `` eccentric and idiomatic delivery '' .
`` krause 's voice contributed significantly to the mood and character of the songs .
`` == name == art bears took their name from a sentence in jane ellen harrison 's book ancient art and ritual ( 1913 ) : `` even to-day , when individualism is rampant , art bears traces of its collective , social origin '' .
chris cutler explains that it was a deliberate out-of-context quote , but that `` not too much should be read into this ; it just sounds intriguing , has an animal in it , plays with ambiguity and is mildly ridiculous '' .
carl had his interest in music as early as he was six when he fell in love with his grandmother 's piano .
he also arranged the pope 's mass , which involved writing for two orchestras and a large voice choir .
dame kiri te kanawa sang his arrangement of e te tarakihi from gisborne in the first live broadcast of the new millennium , to a worldwide television audience of over a hundred million people .
carl is new zealand 's only american platinum selling solo musician .
by the late 1960s , a number of identifiable rock music subgenres had emerged , including hybrids like blues rock , folk rock , country rock , and jazz-rock fusion , many of which contributed to the development of psychedelic rock influenced by the counter-cultural psychedelic scene .
in the second half of the 1970s , punk rock both intensified and reacted against some of these trends to produce a raw , energetic form of music characterized by overt political and social critiques .
punk was an influence into the 1980s on the subsequent development of other subgenres , including new wave , post-punk and eventually the alternative rock movement .
from the 1990s alternative rock began to dominate rock music and break through into the mainstream in the form of grunge , britpop , and indie rock .
further fusion subgenres have since emerged as well as conscious attempts to revisit rock 's history .
the disposable heroes of hiphoprisy was an american industrial hip-hop band , active during the early 1990s .
instruments ) and rono tse ( drums , percussion , programming ) , who had been in the beatnigs .
the band 's name was derived in part from the phrase `` the disposable heroes of hypocrisy '' , used in some socialist literature .
the disposable heroes played many concerts , sometimes opening the bill for more well-known acts such as u2 ( on their landmark zoo tv tour ) , rage against the machine , nirvana and arrested development .
the album also included a cover of the dead kennedys track `` california ber alles '' ( with updated lyrics about governor pete wilson ) .
in common with other bands of the time on both sides of the atlantic ocean , the disposable heroes of hiphoprisy used sampling and scratching as a primary tool of music recording , and mixed rock , hip hop and jazz .
the album was listed in the book `` 1001 albums you must hear before you die '' .
the phrase rocking and rolling originally described the movement of a ship on the ocean , but it was used by the early twentieth century , both to describe a spiritual fervor and as a sexual analogy .
various gospel , blues and swing recordings used the phrase before it became used more frequently  but still intermittently  in the late 1930s and 1940s , principally on recordings and in reviews of what became known as rhythm and blues music aimed at a black audience .
in 1951 , cleveland-based disc jockey alan freed began playing this music style while popularizing the term rock and roll to describe it .
various recordings that date back to the 1940s have been named as the first rock and roll record , including the frequently cited 1951 song `` rocket 88 '' , although some have felt it is too difficult to name one record .
bill haley 's `` rock around the clock '' is often cited as the first rock and roll record to achieve significant commercial success and was joined in 1955 by a number of other records that pioneered the genre .
by that time , the specific phrase `` rocking and rolling '' was also used by african americans in spirituals with a religious connotation .
in 1922 , blues singer trixie smith recorded `` my man rocks me ( with one steady roll ) , '' first featuring the two words in a secular context .
although it was played with a backbeat and was one of the first `` around the clock '' lyrics , this slow minor-key blues was by no means `` rock and roll '' in the later sense .
also in 1927 , traditional country musician uncle dave macon , with his group the fruit jar drinkers , recorded `` sail away ladies '' with a refrain of `` do n't she rock , daddy-o '' , and `` rock about my saro jane '' .
in 1932 , the phrase `` rock and roll '' was heard in the hal roach film asleep in the feet .
allen 's recording was a `` race '' record on the vocalion label , but the tune was quickly covered by white musicians , notably benny goodman with singer helen ward .
other notable recordings using the words , both released in 1938 , were `` rock it for me '' by chick webb , a swing number with ella fitzgerald on vocals featuring the lyrics `` ... wo n't you satisfy my soul , with the rock and roll ?
`` ; and `` rock me '' by sister rosetta tharpe , a gospel song originally written by thomas dorsey as `` hide me in thy bosom '' .
she changed dorsey 's `` singing '' to `` swinging , '' and the way she rolled the `` r '' in `` rock me '' led to the phrase being taken as a double entendre , interpretable as religious or sexual .
in august 1939 , irene castle devised a new dance called `` the castle rock and roll '' , described as `` an easy swing step '' , which she performed at the dancing masters of america convention at the hotel astor .
the marx brothers ' 1941 film the big store featured actress virginia o'brien singing a song starting out as a traditional lullaby which soon changes into a rocking boogie-woogie with lines like `` rock , rock , rock it , baby ... '' ' .
by the early 1940s , the term `` rock and roll '' was also being used in record reviews by billboard journalist and columnist maurie orodenker .
`` as `` an instrumental screamer.. [ which ] .. displays its rock and roll capacities when tackling the righteous rhythms .
`` in the april 25 , 1945 edition , orodenker described erskine hawkins ' version of `` caldonia '' as `` right rhythmic rock and roll music '' , a phrase precisely repeated in his 1946 review of `` sugar lump '' by joe liggins .
such double-entendres were well established in blues music but were new to the radio airwaves .
these songs were generally classed as `` race music '' or , from the late 1940s , `` rhythm and blues '' , and were barely known by mainstream white audiences .
however , in 1951 , cleveland , ohio disc jockey alan freed began broadcasting rhythm , blues , and country music for a multi-racial audience .
originally freed used the name `` moondog '' for himself and any concerts or promotions he put on , because he used as his regular theme music a piece called `` moondog symphony '' by the street musician louis `` moondog '' hardin .
after a night of heavy drinking he and his friends came up with the name the rock and roll party since he was already using the phrase rock and roll session to describe the music he was playing .
african music was modified through the experience of slavery , and through contact with white musical styles such as the folk ballad , and instruments , such as the spanish guitar .
bedrock black church music influenced blues , rural blues influenced white folk song and the black popular music of the northern ghettos , blues and black pop influenced jazz , and so on .
but the single most important process was the influence of black music on white .
according to palmer , by the mid-1930s , elements of rock and roll could be found in every type of american folk and blues music .
some jazz bands , such as count basie 's , increasingly played rhythmic music that was heavily based on blues riffs .
in chicago , blues performers formed into small groups , such as the harlem hamfats , and explored the use of amplification .
in the midwest , jump bands developed instrumental blues based on riffs , with saxophone solos and shouted vocals .
in nashville and elsewhere , country music played by white musicians such as jimmie rodgers incorporated blues styles , and in some cases was recorded with ( uncredited ) black musicians .
in texas and oklahoma , western swing bands , such as bob wills , combined elements of big band , blues and country music into a new style of dance music .
it featured pianist pete johnson and singer big joe turner , whose recording of `` roll 'em pete '' helped spark a craze across american society for `` boogie woogie '' music , mostly played by black musicians .
in both musical and social terms , this helped pave the way for rock and roll music .
this `` jump blues '' encompassed both novelty records , such as those by jordan , and more heavily rhythmic recordings such as those by lionel hampton .
increasingly , the term `` rocking '' was used in the records themselves , and by the late 1940s was frequently used to describe the music of performers such as wynonie harris whose records reached the top of the newly christened `` rhythm and blues '' charts .
in 1947 , blues singer roy brown recorded `` good rocking tonight '' , a song that parodied church music by appropriating its references , including the word `` rocking '' and the gospel call `` have you heard the news ?
the song became much more successful the following year when recorded by wynonie harris , whose version changed the steady blues rhythm to an uptempo gospel beat , and it was re-recorded by elvis presley in 1954 as his second single .
preston 's version is often considered a prototype rock and roll song , and it was covered in 1952 by bill haley and the saddlemen .
as well as `` rocking '' rhythm and blues songs , such as the massively successful and influential `` rocket 88 '' recorded by ike turner and his band but credited to singer jackie brenston , the term was used to encompass other forms of black music .
the adoption of rock and roll by white people was hindered by racist attitudes .
at the same time , younger black musicians such as little richard , chuck berry and bo diddley took advantage of the gradual breakdown of ethnic barriers in america to become equally popular and help launch the rock and roll era .
by the time of haley 's first hits in 1953 , and those of berry , little richard and then presley the next year , rock and roll was firmly established .
the pentecostal church has also been identified as a crucial component in the development of rock and roll .
the modern pentecostal movement parallels rock and roll in many ways .
further , the unhinged , wild energy of the church is evidenced in the most important of early rock performers that were also raised in pentecostal churches , including sister rosetta tharpe , elvis presley , little richard , and jerry lee lewis .
`` sail away ladies '' is a traditional square dance tune , with , in macon 's version , a vocal refrain of `` do n't she rock , daddy-o '' , which in other versions became `` do n't you rock me , daddy-o '' .
recorded on october 10 , 1927 , was a best selling blues , suggested as one of the first million-seller records .
with his chicago five , tampa red later went on to pioneer the chicago small group `` bluebird '' sound , while dorsey became `` the father of gospel music '' .
smith 's tune itself derives from jimmy blythe 's 1925 recording , `` jimmy 's blues '' , and earlier records had been made in a similar style by meade `` lux '' lewis and others .
a hit `` pop '' version of smith 's record was released by tommy dorsey in 1938 , as `` boogie woogie '' .
`` crazy about my baby '' by blind roosevelt graves and brother uaroy , recorded in 1929 , was a rhythmic country blues with small group accompaniment .
researcher gayle dean wardlow has stated that this `` could be considered the first rock 'n ' roll recording '' .
the brothers also recorded rhythmic gospel music .
9 ) '' by jimmie rodgers , recorded on july 16 , 1930 , was one of a series of recordings made by the biggest early star of country music in the late 1920s and early 1930s , based on blues songs he had heard on his travels .
9 '' was recorded with an uncredited louis armstrong ( cornet ) and lil armstrong ( piano ) , foreshadowing later collaborations between black and white musicians but which at the time were almost unprecedented .
this is just one of many recordings by spasm bands , jug bands , and skiffle groups that have the same wild , informal feel that early rock and roll had .
i sit there and rock , i sit there and rock , yeah yeah yeah .
`` ' music historian robert palmer wrote that `` the rhythmic singing , the hard-driving beat , the bluesy melody , and the improvised , stream-of-consciousness words ... all anticipate key aspects of rock 'n roll as it would emerge some 20 years later .
red '' by the harlem hamfats , recorded on april 18 , 1936 , was a hit record made by a small group of jazz and blues musicians assembled by j. mayo williams for the specific purpose of making commercially successful dance records .
`` sing , sing , sing '' by benny goodman , also from 1937 , written by louis prima , featured repeated drum breaks by gene krupa , whose musical nature and high showmanship presaged rock and roll drumming .
many later rock and roll stars , including elvis presley , jerry lee lewis , and little richard , cited tharpe 's singing , electric guitar playing , and energetic performance style as an influence .
she also re-recorded the song with lucky millinder 's band in 1942 , when columnist maurie orodenker described her vocals as `` rock-and-roll spiritual singing '' .
`` ida red '' by bob wills and the texas playboys , recorded in 1938 by a western swing band , featuring electric guitar by eldon shamblin .
the tune was recycled again some years later by chuck berry in `` maybellene '' .
`` down the road a piece '' by the will bradley orchestra , a smooth rocking boogie number , was recorded in august 1940 with drummer `` eight beat mack '' ray mckinley sharing the vocals with the song 's writer , don raye .
the song would later become a rock and roll standard .
`` flying home '' was most famously recorded in 1942 by lionel hampton and his orchestra , with tenor sax solo by illinois jacquet , recreated and refined live by arnett cobb .
this became a model for rock and roll solos ever since : emotional , honking , long , not just an instrumental break but the keystone of the song .
king credits walker as inspiring him to take up the electric guitar , but his influence extended far beyond the blues to jazz and rock and roll .
jive '' , had been the first record by a black performer to top both the pop and r & b charts .
it featured tharpe on an electric guitar and is considered an important precursor to rock and roll .
`` guitar boogie '' by arthur smith , originally recorded in 1945 but not a hit until reissued in 1948 , was the first boogie woogie played on the electric guitar , and was much imitated by later rock and roll guitarists .
the tune was based on `` pinetop 's boogie woogie '' from 1929 .
the song was co-written by slack with don raye , and , like raye 's `` down the road a piece '' , was later recorded by many rock and roll singers .
morse was one of the first white singers to perform what would now be regarded as rhythm and blues music .
it was the precursor of many similar novelty r & b-based records , which became a mainstay of early rock and roll in recordings by groups such as the coasters .
it was williams ' first hit on the country music charts , reaching # 4 .
it used a similar melody to jim jackson 's 1927 `` kansas city blues '' and was itself adapted several years later for `` rock around the clock '' .
`` good rocking tonight '' , in separate versions by roy brown ( 1947 ) and wynonie harris ( 1948 ) led to a craze for blues with `` rocking '' in the title .
`` boogie chillen ' '' ( or `` boogie chillun '' ) is a blues song written by john lee hooker and recorded in 1948 .
the guitar figure from `` boogie chillen ' '' has been called `` the riff that launched a million songs '' , inspiring many popular blues and rock songs .
it is considered one of the blues recordings most influential on the forthcoming rock 'n ' roll .
it has been cited as a contender for the `` first rock and roll record '' title and a `` much more appropriate candidate '' than the more frequently cited `` rocket 88 '' ( 1951 ) .
although haley first recorded in 1946 , his early recordings , including `` rovin ' eyes '' , were essentially in the western swing style of country music , as was his 1951 cover of `` rocket 88 '' ( see below ) .
`` the fat man '' by fats domino , recorded in new orleans on december 10 , 1949 , featured domino on wah-wah mouth trumpet as well as piano and vocals .
it was the first of domino 's 35 us top 40 hits and helped establish his career ; he also played piano on lloyd price 's big 1952 hit , `` lawdy , miss clawdy '' .
louis ' electric guitar work is also considered a distant ancestor of heavy metal music .
`` sixty minute man '' by the dominoes , recorded on december 30 , 1950 , was the first ( and most sexually explicit ) big r & b hit to cross over to the pop charts .
mcphatter later became lead singer of the drifters , and then a solo star .
one of anita o'day 's few compositions , she was one of the best jazz singers ever , and recorded this blues single on mercury records with her own orchestra .
this was a big hit in 1954 , and is credited by rock n ' roll authority , jay warner , as being `` the first rock n ' roll hit by a rock and roll group '' .
`` crazy man , crazy '' by bill haley and his comets , recorded in april 1953 , was the first of his recordings to make the billboard pop chart .
this was not a cover , but an original composition , and has been described as `` the first white rock hit '' .
it was an electric blues song that had a major impact on rock & roll and featured distorted overtones on the electric guitar a full decade before jimi hendrix .
haley 's version , which was substantially different in lyric and arrangement , reached no 7 in the pop chart at the end of august and predated his much wider success with `` rock around the clock '' by almost a year .
elvis presley 's later 1956 version combined haley 's arrangement with turner 's lyrics , but was not a substantial hit .
`` rock around the clock '' by bill haley and his comets ( recorded on april 12 , 1954 ) was the first number one rock and roll record on the us pop charts .
the record is often credited with propelling rock into the mainstream , at least the teen mainstream .
the other side of cotton 's `` cotton crop blues '' single , `` hold me in your arms , '' also featured a heavily distorted guitar sound by hare that resembles the `` distorted tones favored by modern rock players .
`` '' that 's all right '' by elvis presley , was recorded on july 5 , 1954 .
this cover of arthur crudup 's tune was presley 's first single .
its b-side was a rocking version of bill monroe 's bluegrass song `` blue moon of kentucky '' , itself recognized by various rock singers as an influence on the music .
== views on the first rock and roll record == the identity of the first rock and roll record is one of the most enduring subjects of debate among rock historians .
various recordings dating back to the 1940s and 1950s have been cited as the first rock and roll record .
its characterization as a rock and roll or rhythm and blues song continues to be debated .
nigel williamson questions whether it was really an r & b song `` with an unusually fast , bottom-heavy eight-to-the bar boogie rhythm and a great lyric about cars , booze and women '' .
palmer wrote that `` rocket 88 '' is credited for its raucous saxophone , boogie-woogie beat , fuzzy amplified guitar , and lyrics that celebrate the automobile .
roger wood and john nova lomax have also cited `` rock awhile '' as the first rock & roll record .
others have taken the view that the first was roy brown 's `` good rocking tonight '' , or wynonie harris ' 1948 version ; the song received greater exposure when elvis presley covered it in 1954 .
most rock historians have cited bill haley 's 1953 song `` crazy man , crazy '' as the first rock and roll record to reach the billboard charts .
haley 's `` rock around the clock '' released in 1954 was the first rock and roll record to achieve significant commercial success and was joined in 1955 by a number of other records that pioneered the genre .
along with `` rock around the clock '' , several rock critics have also pointed to presley 's `` that 's all right '' from 1954 as a candidate for the first rock and roll record .
the 1992 book what was the first rock'n'roll record by jim dawson and steve propes discusses 50 contenders , from illinois jacquet 's `` blues , part 2 '' ( 1944 ) to elvis presley 's `` heartbreak hotel '' ( 1956 ) , without reaching a definitive conclusion .
that , say dawson and propes , was the first music being called rock 'n ' roll during that short time when the term caught on all over america .
because the honking tenor saxophone was the driving force at those shows and on many of the records freed was playing , the authors began their list with a 1944 squealing and squawking live performance by illinois jacquet with jazz at the philharmonic in los angeles in mid-1944 .
in 2004 , elvis presley 's `` that 's all right mama '' and bill haley 's `` rock around the clock '' both celebrated their 50th anniversaries .
rolling stone felt that presley 's song was the first rock and roll recording .
the guardian felt that while there were rock'n'roll records before presley 's , his recording was the moment when all the strands came together in `` perfect embodiment '' .
presley himself is quoted as saying : `` a lot of people seem to think i started this business , but rock 'n ' roll was here a long time before i came along .
`` also formative in the sound of rock and roll were little richard and chuck berry .
from the early 1950s , little richard combined gospel with new orleans r & b , heavy backbeat , pounding piano and wailing vocals .
early rock and roll used the twelve-bar blues chord progression and shared with boogie woogie the four beats ( usually broken down into eight eighth-notes/quavers ) to a bar .
rock and roll however has a greater emphasis on the backbeat than boogie woogie .
bo diddley 's 1955 hit `` bo diddley '' , with its b-side `` i 'm a man '' , introduced a new beat and unique guitar style that inspired many artists without either side using the 12-bar pattern  they instead played variations on a single chord each .
others point out that performers like arthur crudup and fats domino were recording blues songs as early as 1946 that are indistinguishable from later rock and roll , and that these blues songs were based on themes , chord changes , and rhythms dating back decades before that .
big joe turner 's 1939 recording `` roll 'em pete '' is close to 1950s rock and roll .
pushing the date back even earlier , blues researcher gayle dean wardlow has stated that `` crazy about my baby '' by blind roosevelt graves and his brother , recorded in 1929 , `` could be considered the first rock 'n ' roll recording '' .
writer nick tosches similarly felt that , `` it is impossible to discern the first modern rock record , just as it is impossible to discern where blue becomes indigo in the spectrum .

the singing mainly involves chanting the names of krishna , in a call and response style .
he became increasingly involved in work with amateur choirs and school singing , and he became a very popular choir conductor , who led several choirs to many musical successes , often with his own choir arrangements , based on folk melodies .
the strong folk singing tradition that he experienced in his childhood snderjylland under german rule became decisively influential during his later career .
in the late 1940s he began collecting sound recordings of folk singing in marginal , rural areas of jylland , and in the 1960s he continued this work in the isolated faroe islands in the north atlantic .
alongside teaching and collection work , clausen also began studying the history of danish and north german folk singing , and put folk singing into a new context , incorporating historical , religious and sociological aspects , as reflected in various articles , as well as a textbook .
danish culture and language were , however , kept alive , not least through the growth of a quite strong folk singing culture .
as a young , talented pianist , he studied piano with roger henrichsen .
in 1936 he was appointed technical inspector at the musical night school of the city of copenhagen , and during the following years under his leadership choir singing experienced a significant lift in both quality and diversity .
his choir performances began to be radio broadcast , and he also began a long series of radio programmes about songs and folk singing , which gradually led him to take up musicological research in folk singing on a larger scale .
in 1948 he wrote an article about danish folk singing for the musicological magnum opus om musik ii , and in 1958 came his comprehensive textbook on the subject , which was reprinted 1975 .
the book contained a wealth of new information and new perspectives on the interplay between historical events , social conditions and folk singing .
during his first years in aarhus , he carried out song collections in south and west jylland , but his last years were more and more focused on faroese folk singing .
he went on several collection trips to the islands , where he primarily focused on the hitherto rather obscure religious kingo-singing and spiritual singing , of which he collected several hundred recordings .
in 1938 , he received a scholarship , det anckerske legat , and spent the following year in paris , where he studied composition with darius milhaud , which resulted in a wind quintet 1939 and a flute concert 1940 .
=== compositions === klokken ( 1934 ) ( school opera ) tema med variationer ( 1936 ) ( for orchestra ) vor sol er bleven kold ( 1937 ?
in the 1950s and 60s , he made extensive collections on tape recorder of folk singing in south and west jutland .
based on the recordings , he made a series of radio broadcasts , and published several articles about folk singing , as well as his principal work dansk folkesang gennem 150 r , from 1958 .
during his years at rungsted statsskole , karl clausen had faroese students , who introduced him to their folk singing , which was still thriving , because the modernist outlook and technology of post world war ii europe was only slowly being introduced in these remote islands .
he was fascinated by the vigorous folk singing tradition of the faroese , and 1967-72 went on several collection trips to the islands , where he collected several hundred examples of religious spiritual singing and kingo-singing .

dr. barnett even makes an appearance on the joe pyne tv show to voice his support of the hippie community and the use of lsd .
as another hippie in attendance calms the audience and elliot sees his new leader for their cult-like organization , larry realizes that his assassination of dr. barnett simply made him a martyr for the hippie movement .

art pop ( also typeset as art-pop or artpop ) is a loosely defined style of pop music influenced by pop art and the integration of high and low culture .
drawing on postmodern approaches and art theories as well as other forms of art , such as fine art , fashion , cinema , and avant-garde literature , art pop emphasizes the manipulation of signs , style , and gesture over personal expression .
art pop artists deviate from traditional rock music conventions and pop audiences , exploring ideas such as pop 's status as commercial art , notions of artifice , the self as a construction , and questions of historical authenticity .
starting in the mid 1960s , british and american pop musicians began incorporating the ideas of the pop art movement and pseudo-symphonic textures to their recordings .
english art pop musicians drew from their art school studies , while in america the style intersected with the beat generation and folk music 's subsequent singer-songwriter movement .
the genre further developed with artists who rejected conventional rock instrumentation and structure in favor of dance styles and the synthesizer .
the 2010s saw new art pop trends develop , such as hip hop artists drawing on visual art and vaporwave artists exploring elements of contemporary capitalism .
== characteristics == art pop emphasizes the manipulation of signs over personal expression , drawing on an aesthetic of the everyday and the disposable , in distinction to the romantic and autonomous tradition embodied by art rock ( also known as progressive rock ) .
sociomusicologist simon frith has distinguished the appropriation of art into pop music as having a particular concern with style , gesture , and the ironic use of historical eras and genres .
drawing on postmodernism 's breakdown of the high/low cultural boundary , frith says that art pop artists trouble issues of sociological interpretation and historical authenticity , instead exploring concepts of artifice .
cultural theorist mark fisher wrote that the development of art pop evolved out of the triangulation of pop , art , and fashion .
according to critic stephen holden , art pop often refers to any pop style which deliberately aspires to the formal values of classical music and poetry , though these works are often marketed by commercial interests rather than respected cultural institutions .
writers for the independent and the financial times have noted the attempts of art pop music to distance its audiences from the public at large .
it is , if you like , a way of making pure formalism socially acceptable in a pop context .
== history == === background === the boundaries between art and pop music became increasingly blurred throughout the second half of the 20th century .
in the 1960s , pop musicians such as john lennon , syd barrett , pete townshend , brian eno , and bryan ferry began to take inspiration from their previous art school studies .
frith states that in britain , art school represented `` a traditional escape route for the bright working class kids , and a breeding ground for young bands like the beatles and beyond '' .
in north america , art pop was influenced by bob dylan and the beat generation , and became more literary through folk music 's singer-songwriter movement .
before progressive/art rock became the most commercially successful british sound of the early 1970s , the 1960s psychedelic movement brought together art and commercialism , broaching the question of what it meant to be an `` artist '' in a mass medium .
progressive musicians thought that artistic status depended on personal autonomy , and so the strategy of `` progressive '' rock groups was to present themselves as performers and composers `` above '' normal pop practice .
another chief influence on the development of art pop was the pop art movement .
the term `` pop art '' , first coined to describe the aesthetic value of mass-produced goods , was directly applicable to the contemporary phenomenon of rock and roll ( including elvis presley , an early pop art icon ) .
progressive rock was the bohemians ' last bet ...
`` warhol 's factory house band the velvet underground was an american group who emulated warhol 's art/pop synthesis , echoing his emphasis on simplicity , and pioneering a modernist avant-garde approach to art rock that ignored the conventional hierarchies of artistic representation .
pepper 's lonely hearts club band was `` perceived as largely responsible for the connections between art and pop to be made explicit .
pepper 's was preceded by several albums that had begun to bridge the line between `` disposable '' pop and `` serious '' rock , it successfully gave an established `` commercial '' voice to an alternative youth culture .
author michael johnson wrote that art pop music would continue to exist subsequent to the beatles , but without ever achieving their level of popular success .
the who was labelled `` the first pop art band '' by their manager , while member pete townshend explains : `` we stand for pop art clothes , pop art music and pop art behaviour ... we do n't change offstage ; we live pop art .
`` the effect of the velvet underground gave rock musicians like iggy pop of the stooges a self-consciousness about their work .
pop was inspired to transform his personality into an art object , which would in turn influence singer david bowie , and led to the stooges ' role as the group linking 1960s hard rock to 1970s punk .
`` the glam rock scene of the early 1970s would again draw widely on art school sensibilities .
pepper 's , glam emphasized outlandish costumes , theatrical performances , and allusions to throwaway pop culture phenomena , becoming one of the most deliberately visual phenomena to emerge in rock music .
some of its artists , like bowie , roxy music , and ex-velvet underground member lou reed , would continue the practices associated with the modernist avant-garde branch of art rock .
bowie , a former art-school student and painter , made visual presentation a central aspect of his work , deriving his concept of art pop from the work and attitudes of warhol and the velvet underground .
roxy music is expressed by frith as the `` archetypical art pop band .
`` frontman bryan ferry incorporated the influence of his mentor , pop art pioneer richard hamilton while synthesizer player brian eno drew on his study of cybernetics and art under theorist roy ascott .
this redefined progressive rock and revitalized the idea of the romantic artist in terms of media fame .
according to armond white , roxy music 's engagement with pop art practices effectively `` showed that pop 's surface frivolity and deep pleasure were legitimate and commanding pursuits .
`` after leaving roxy music in 1973 , eno would further explore art pop styles on a series of experimental solo albums .
as eno developed warhol 's arguments in a different direction from his contemporaries , he became a ubiquitous entity in 1970s pop music .
=== 1970s80s : post-punk developments === cultural theorist mark fisher characterized a variety of musical developments in the late 1970s , including post-punk , industrial music , synthpop , and particularly the work of german electronic band kraftwerk , as situated within art pop traditions .
he states that bowie and roxy music 's english style of art pop `` culminated '' with the music of the british group japan .
brian eno and john cale would serve a crucial part in the careers of bowie , talking heads , and many key punk and post-punk records .
fisher characterized subsequent artists such as grace jones , the new romantic groups of the 1980s , and risn murphy as a part of an art pop lineage .
he noted that the development of art pop involved the rejection of conventional rock instrumentation and structure in favor of dance styles and the synthesizer .

in may 1966 they filmed two sets of colour promotional clips for their current single `` rain '' / '' paperback writer '' all directed by michael lindsay-hogg , who went on to direct the rolling stones rock and roll circus and the beatles final film let it be .
during late 197273 david bowie featured in a series of promotional films directed by pop photographer mick rock , who worked extensively with bowie in this period .
`` country music historian bob millard wrote that jmi had pioneered the country music video concept by `` producing a 3-minute film '' to go along with williams ' song .
promotional videos of country music songs , however , continued to be produced .
the success of his early efforts encouraged mulcahy to quit his tv job and become a full-time director , and he made clips for several popular australian acts including stylus , marcia hines , hush and ac/dc .
in 1975 , the british rock band queen employed bruce gowers to make a promotional video to show their new single `` bohemian rhapsody '' on the bbc music series top of the pops .
according to rock historian paul fowles , the song is `` widely credited as the first global hit single for which an accompanying video was central to the marketing strategy '' .
the advent of high-quality color videotape recorders and portable video cameras coincided with the diy ethos of the new wave era , enabling many pop acts to produce promotional videos quickly and cheaply , in comparison to the relatively high costs of using film .
one notable later example of the non-representational style is bill konersman 's innovative 1987 video for prince 's `` sign o ' the times ''  influenced by dylan 's `` subterranean homesick blues '' clip , it featured only the text of the song 's lyrics .
in 1986 , peter gabriel 's song `` sledgehammer '' used special effects and animation techniques developed by british studio aardman animation .
in the mid to late 1990s , walter stern directed `` firestarter '' by the prodigy , `` bitter sweet symphony '' by the verve , and `` teardrop '' by massive attack .
the video also received four nominations at the 2010 mtv video music awards , making 30 seconds to mars the most nominated rock artist in vma history for a single year .
all of these swiftly recorded clips are made with minimal budgets and share similar aesthetics with the lo-fi music movement of the early nineties .
as such , they are often created with relative ease , and often act as a supplemental video to a more traditional music video .
in 1987 , prince released a video for his song `` sign o ' the times '' .
he had refused to make a traditional music video , so his label released a simple clip that displayed the song 's lyrics on a black screen .
`` the episode explored the impact of mtv rock video violence on the youth of the early 1980s .
dr. thomas radecki of the national coalition on tv violence was interviewed accusing the fledgling rock video business of excessive violence .
examples of this tactic were duran duran 's aforementioned `` girls on film '' and frankie goes to hollywood with `` relax '' , directed by bernard rose .
in 1993 , australian rock band inxs ' song `` the gift '' was banned by mtv because of its use of holocaust and gulf war footage , among images of famine , pollution , war and terrorism .
in 2001 , bjrk 's video for `` pagan poetry '' was banned from mtv for depictions of sexual intercourse , fellatio , and body piercings .
her next single , `` cocoon '' , was also banned by mtv as it featured a nude bjrk ( though the nude body was actually a fitted body suit rigged with red string ) .
the following year , eminem 's video for `` just lose it '' caused controversy over its parody of michael jackson 's 2005 child molestation trial , plastic surgery , and hair catching fire during the filming of a pepsi commercial .
while country music has largely avoided controversy surrounding video content , it has not been immune .
percy faith ( april 7 , 1908  february 9 , 1976 ) was a canadian bandleader , orchestrator , composer and conductor , known for his lush arrangements of pop and christmas standards .
though his professional orchestra-leading career began at the height of the swing era , faith refined and rethought orchestration techniques , including use of large string sections , to soften and fill out the brass-dominated popular music of the 1940s .
he played violin and piano as a child , and played in theatres and at massey hall .
though faith initially mined the worlds of broadway , hollywood and latin music for many of his top-selling 1950s recordings , he enjoyed popularity starting in 1962 with his orchestral versions of popular rock and pop hits of the day .
faith 's first single with a female chorus , `` yellow days , '' was a substantial hit in the mor ( middle of the road ) easy listening radio format of the mid-1960s .
though best known for his recording career , faith also occasionally scored motion pictures , and received an academy award nomination for his adaptation of the song score for the doris day musical feature , love me or leave me .
faith also composed the popular theme for the long running nbc series the virginian .
with the advent of harder rock sounds in the 1970s , faith 's elegant arrangements fell out of favor with the listening and record-buying public , although he continued to release albums as diverse and contemporary as jesus christ superstar and black magic woman .
he studied piano under frederick bried .
in 1963 nero composed and performed the musical score for the major motion picture sunday in new york .
the title song has been recorded by over two dozen vocalists and the score was nominated for both a golden globe and hollywood reporter award .
nero has worked with a long list of notable musicians including frank sinatra , mel torme , andy williams , ray charles , dizzy gillespie , diane schuur , johnny mathis , roger kellaway and elton john .
nero 's recordings include albums with symphony orchestras : on my own , classical connections and my way .
rage against the machine ( also known as ratm or simply rage ) is an american rock band from los angeles , california .
they draw inspiration from early heavy metal instrumentation , as well as hip hop acts such as afrika bambaataa , public enemy , the beastie boys , and dutch crossover band urban dance squad .
de la rocha started a low-key solo career , while the rest of the band formed the rock supergroup audioslave with chris cornell , then-former frontman of soundgarden ; audioslave recorded three albums before disbanding in 2007 .
the newly christened rage against the machine named themselves after a song de la rocha had written for his former popular underground hardcore punk band , inside out ( also to be the title of the unrecorded inside out full-length album ) .
kent mcclard , with whom inside out were associated , had coined the phrase `` rage against the machine '' in a 1989 article in his zine no answers .
`` === 19922000 : mainstream success === the band 's debut album , rage against the machine , reached triple platinum status , driven by heavy radio play of the song `` killing in the name '' , a heavy , driving track featuring only eight lines of lyrics .
subsequently , they re-recorded the song `` darkness '' from their original demo for the soundtrack of the crow , while `` no shelter '' appeared on the godzilla soundtrack .
in 1997 , the band opened for u2 on their popmart tour , for which all of rage 's profits went to support social organizations , including u.n.i.t.e.
, women alive and the zapatista front for national liberation .
rage subsequently began an abortive headlining us tour with special guests wu-tang clan .
the track `` calm like a bomb '' was later featured in the film 's sequel , 2003 's the matrix reloaded .
in 2000 , the band planned to support the beastie boys on the `` rhyme and reason '' tour ; however , the tour was cancelled when beastie boys drummer mike d suffered a serious injury .
& rakim , bruce springsteen , the stooges , and bob dylan .
audioslave released its third album revelations on september 5 , 2006 , but an accompanying tour never occurred as cornell and morello were working on solo albums .
morello began his own solo career in 2003 , playing political acoustic folk music at open-mic nights and various clubs under the alias the nightwatchman , which he formed as an outlet for his political views while playing apolitical music with audioslave .
in february 2007 , he announced a solo album , entitled one man revolution , which was released in april 2007 .
during the latter days of his career as the nightwatchman , morello joined up with boots riley and formed the rap rock group street sweeper social club , which released its debut self-titled album in june 2009 .
meanwhile , de la rocha had been working on a solo album collaboration with dj shadow , company flow , roni size and the roots ' questlove , but dropped the project in favor of working with nine inch nails ' trent reznor .
in late 2005 , de la rocha was seen singing and playing the jarana huasteca with son jarocho band son de madera on multiple occasions .
the reunion was described by morello as primarily being a vehicle to voice the band 's opposition to the `` right-wing purgatory '' the united states has `` slid into '' under the george w. bush administration since ratm 's dissolution .
the band also performed on august 2 , 2008 , in chicago as one of the headliners ( radiohead , kanye west and nine inch nails being the other three ) for the 2008 lollapalooza music festival .
it generated nationwide publicity and took the track `` killing in the name '' to the coveted christmas number one slot in the uk singles chart , which had been dominated for four consecutive years from 2005 by winners from the popular tv show the x factor .
, the prodigy , stereophonics , bbc radio 5 live , and even the 2004 x factor winner steve brookstein , amongst numerous others .
this is different and we project a lot : we are working on a new album due out next year , perhaps summer for the northern hemisphere .
`` == musical style and influences == rage against the machine has been noted for its `` fiercely polemical music , which brewed sloganeering leftist rants against corporate america , cultural imperialism , and government oppression into a molotov cocktail of punk rock , hip-hop , and thrash .
the band is associated with the 1990s alternative movement .
their music has been described as rap metal , rap rock , funk metal , alternative metal , and nu metal .
he first played the piano at age three .
weertz majored in piano at drake university in des moines , but claimed he was expelled for playing `` smoke gets in your eyes '' in the practice room .
he then moved to new york city to attend juilliard , where he studied jazz piano under lennie tristano and teddy wilson .
in 1955 williams recorded `` autumn leaves '' , the only piano instrumental to reach # 1 on billboard 's popular music chart .
it was the fourth # 1 song of the `` rock era , '' which unofficially began with the ascension of `` ( we 're gon na ) rock around the clock '' by bill haley & his comets into the top spot .
in 1966 he had another top ten hit with the song `` born free '' from the motion picture soundtrack .
billboard magazine ranks him as the top selling piano recording artist in history with 18 gold and platinum albums to his credit .
on his 75th birthday , williams performed his first 12-hour piano marathon .
his steinway & sons `` gold steinway '' grand piano was on tour for public display and entertainment during 20072008 .
after a piano concert by ignacy jan paderewski , he waited for 45 minutes outside in cold weather to meet paderewski .
it is a moslem-influenced style , mostly in the form of praise songs , that uses only traditional yoruba instruments such as the solemn-sounding goje violin , and the small round sakara drum , which is similar to a tambourine and is beaten with a stick .
sakara music overlays the nasalized , melismatic vocals of islamic music on the traditional percussion instruments .
fuji music is a mixture of muslim traditional were music with elements drawn from sakara and apala music .
the term shanty most accurately refers to a specific style of work song belonging to this historical repertoire .
however , in recent , popular usage , the scope of its definition is sometimes expanded to admit a wider range of repertoire and characteristics , or to refer to a `` maritime work song '' in general .
of uncertain etymological origin , the word shanty emerged in the mid-19th century in reference to an appreciably distinct genre of work song , developed especially in american-style merchant vessels that had come to prominence in decades prior to the american civil war .
the practice of singing shanties eventually became ubiquitous internationally and throughout the era of wind-driven packet and clipper ships .
shanty repertoire borrowed from the contemporary popular music enjoyed by sailors , including minstrel music , popular marches , and land-based folk songs , which were adapted to suit musical forms matching the various labor tasks required to operate a sailing ship .
the shanty genre was typified by flexible lyrical forms , which in practice provided for much improvisation and the ability to lengthen or shorten a song to match the circumstances .
its hallmark was call and response , performed between a soloist and the rest of the workers in chorus .
the leader , called the shantyman , was appreciated for his piquant language , lyrical wit , and strong voice .
information about shanties was preserved by veteran sailors and by folklorist song-collectors , and their written and audio-recorded work provided resources that would later support a revival in singing shanties as a land-based leisure activity .
recent performances range from the `` traditional '' style of practitioners within a revival-oriented , maritime music scene , to the adoption of shanty repertoire by musicians in a variety of popular styles .
== word == === etymology === the origin of the word `` shanty '' is unknown , though several inconclusive theories have been put forth .
`` the phenomenon of using songs or chants , in some form , to accompany sea labor preceded the emergence of the term `` shanty '' in the historical record of the mid-19th century .
`` this reference to singing stevedores as `` chanty men '' connects the genre to a still earlier reference to chanty-man as the foreman of a work gang and the lead singer of their songs .
while the above noted , american sources used a `` ch '' spelling , the next published appearances of the term , coming in two very similar articles from british publications from 1868 and 1869 , used `` shanty .
in his subsequent shanty collections he used this spelling consistently .
american shanty-collector joanna colcord made great use of terry 's first book ( corresponding with the author , and reprinting some of his material ) , and she , too , deemed it sensible to adopt the `` sh '' spelling for her 1924 collection .
terry 's works were the source for those among the earliest of commercial recordings ( see below ) and popular performances of shantiesespecially because , unlike many earlier works , they provided scores with piano accompaniment and sufficiently long , performance-ready sets of lyrics .
terry and colcord 's works were followed by numerous shanty collections and scores that also chose to use the `` sh '' spelling , whereas others remained insistent that `` ch '' be retained to preserve what they believed to be the etymological origins of the term .
the phrase `` sea shanty '' carries a similar redundancy to that of the phrases `` atm machine '' or `` chai tea '' , in that the word `` shanty '' alone already conveys the meaning of a sea-related work song .
during the 1920s , the phrase came into regular use by lay commentators , though it was not documented in use by sailors themselves , nor has it been used by knowledgeable authors on the subject such as stan hugill .
liberal use of the word `` shanty '' by folklorists of the 20th century expanded the term 's conceptual scope to include `` sea-related work songs '' in general .
however , the shanty genre is distinct among various global work song phenomena .
its formal characteristics , specific manner of use , and repertoire cohere to form a picture of a work song genre that emerged in the atlantic merchant trade of the early 19th century .
in historical hindsight these items have come to be generically called `` sing-outs '' ; yet even before the known advent of the term shanty , richard henry dana referred to `` singing out .
`` the wind was whistling through the rigging , loose ropes flying about ; loud and , to me , unintelligible orders constantly given and rapidly executed , and the sailors `` singing out '' at the ropes in their hoarse and peculiar strains .
==== early anglo-british and american sailor work songs ==== a step up in sophistication from the sing-outs was represented by the first widely established sailors ' work song of the 19th century , `` cheer'ly man .
when we came to mast-head the top-sail yards , with all hands at the halyards , we struck up `` cheerily , men , '' with a chorus which might have been heard half way to staten land .
the decks were all life and commotion ; the sailors on the forecastle singing , `` ho , cheerly men !
in the first place , singing while working was generally limited to merchant ships , not war ships .
the royal navy banned singing during workit was thought the noise would make it harder for the crew to hear commandsthough capstan work was accompanied by the bosun 's pipe , or else by fife and drum or fiddle .
while this practice was analogous to the practice of what is later called singing `` capstan shanties , '' the form of these verses is not particularly similar to later shanties .
these songs do not appear to correspond to any shanty known from later eras .
it is possible that the long , monotonous task of heaving the capstan had long inspired the singing of time-passing songs of various sorts , such as those in the quid .
for example , the composition of capstan-style `` sailor songs '' by norwegian poet henrik wergeland as early as 1838 implies that scandinavians also used such songs .
however , these older songs can be distinguished from the later type of songs that were given the label shanty , suggesting there were other formative influences that gave birth to an appreciably new and distinctly recognized phenomenon .
such references begin to appear in the late 18th century , whence one can see the clich develop that black africans `` could not '' work without singing .
`` so while the depth of the african-american work song traditions is now recognized , in the early 19th century they stood in stark contrast to the paucity of such traditions among euro-americans .
an example of a work song that was shared between several contexts , including , eventually , sailors working , is `` grog time o ' day .
shanty-writer stan hugill called mobile bayone of the main cotton outportsa `` shanty mart , '' at which sailors and laborers of different cultural backgrounds traded their songs .
an early article to offer an opinion on the origin of shanties ( though not calling them by that name ) , appearing in oberlin college 's student paper in 1858 , drew a comparison between africans ' singing and sailor work songs .
he claimed they were singing , `` heigh jim along , jim along josey , heigh jim along , jim along jo !
`` the implication is that this song was similar to a sailor song , probably the well-known shanty , `` haul away , joe '' or `` haul away for rosie , '' viz .
`` the writer did not make a further connection to the minstrel song `` jim along josey , '' a relationship to which is obvious , although it is unknown whether this was the inspiration for the shanty or vice versa .
in much of the shanty repertoire known today one finds parallels to the minstrel songs that came to popularity from the 1840s .
they were barbaric in their wild melody .
his , then , was an impression of shanties based on their style and manner of performance , and he was writing at a time when shanties had yet to become framed by writers and media as belonging to any canon of national `` folk music .
it is noteworthy that the old voyagers do not hint at the sailors singing out or encouraging their efforts by choruses when at work .
they received a boost from the heavy emigrant movement of gold rushes in california and australia .
`` ==== heyday and decline ==== by the american civil war , the shanty form was fully developed , after which its repertoire grew and its implementation was widespread and rather standardized .
=== 20th century === ==== formative writing ==== folklorists of the first decade of the 20th century , especially those from britain , included shanties among their interests in collecting folk songs connected with the idea of national heritage .
most editors presented `` ideal '' versions of songsnot reflecting any one way the shanty may have been sung , but rather a composite picture , edited for print .
as a result , though much of the vanishing shanty repertoire was preserved in skeletal form , aspects of the genre were re-envisioned according to contemporary perceptions .
for example , he admits to never having heard a pumping shanty , and yet he goes on to present one without citing its source .
so for example , masefield implied that the shanty `` a-roving '' ( which he titled `` the maid of amsterdam '' ) was derived from thomas heywood 's the tragedy of the rape of lucrece ( 1608 ) .
lyrics and ideas from masefield 's collection became among the most quoted or plagiarized in later shanty collections , and by their sheer ubiquity these contributed to 20th century audiences ' perceptions of the genre .
he took a firm stance that only true work songs should be included in his collection , thus resisting the temptation to let shanties slide into the genres of ballads or other off-duty songs .
( pressure of his publisher forced him to include two sea songs , clearly demarcated , at the end of the book .
sharp responds to bullen 's claims of african-american origins by ceding that many shanties were influenced through the singing of black shantymena position that assumes english folk song was the core of the tradition by default .
while sharp 's manner of documenting shanties was more or less objective , the field of his research and his biases in what to collect certainly influenced the outcome of this study .
by the 1920s , the proliferation of shanty collections had begun to facilitate a revival in shanty singing as entertainment for laypersons ( see below ) , which in turn created a market for more shanty collections that were geared towards a general audience .
==== field-recording ==== even while the proliferation of soft-scholarly books was reifying the shanty repertoire , a few american scholars were audio-recording some of the last surviving sailors that had sung shanties as part of their daily work .
robert winslow gordon , founding head of the archive of american folk song at the library of congress , recorded sailors singing shanties in the san francisco bay area in the early 1920s .
he later made recordings of african-american work songs in georgia and elsewhere , and sought to demonstrate correspondences between these and the shanty genre .
with respect to methodology , hugill aimed to be as inclusive as possibleto account for and to present , if sometimes only in fragments , any and all items of shanty repertoire that he was currently able to find .
hugill readily included more recently popular songsthose that evidently were not sung until after the shanty genre was experiencing decline , but which were extant when hugill sailed ( 1920s40s ) .
with respect to chronological position , while hugill is affectionately known as `` the last shantyman , '' he was also one of the last original shanty collectors .
the book 's `` authoritative '' position is bolstered by the personal image of its author .
==== revival ==== even as shanty singing to accompany work aboard ships was `` dying , '' interest was being taken in `` reviving '' itas a type of leisure pastime .
most shanty singing since the mid-20th century or earlier is considered to be in such a `` revival '' vein .
a few of the editors of early shanty collections provided arrangements for pianoforte accompaniment with their shanties .
one of the earliest shanty collections , davis and tozer 's sailor songs or 'chanties ' ( which circulated in the early 1890s ) , included such accompaniment , along with safe , `` drawing room '' style lyrics .
it is unknown whether any actual performances were based on this otherwise influential work , however , the proceedings from a meeting of the manchester literary club , 4 february 1895 , record an instance of laypersons attempting to recreate shanty performance at that early date .
in general , shanty performance by laypersons , up through the first two decades of the 20th century , would have been hindered by the lack of suitable resources , if not lack of interest .
a description of the daily training schedule included the following note : recreation includes singing , for each ship is supplied with a piano .
on shore , a revival in shanty singing for leisure was facilitated by song collections of the 1920s , especially terry 's the shanty book ( in two volumes , 1921 and 1926 ) .
what set apart this and following collections was full musical score along with an adequate stock of lyrics .
collections prior to terry 's ( except for davis and tozer 's much earlier and contrived-sounding settings ) had not provided enough verses to create `` full '' songs , and it is unlikely that performers would venture to improvise new verses in the manner of traditional shantymen .
by 1926 , it had become a custom at the seven seas club in london to hold a shanty sing-along after the club 's monthly dinners .
by 1928 , commercial recordings of shanties , performed in the manner of classical concert singing , had been released on hmv , vocalion , parlophone , edison , aco , and columbia labels ; many were realizations of scores from terry 's collection .
he was generally mysterious about the sources of his shanty arrangements ; he obviously referred to collections by editors like sharp , colcord , and doerflinger , however it is often unclear when and whether his versions were based in field experience or his private invention .
through the mass distribution of particular shanty forms through recordings and clubs , the folk revival has had the effect of creating an impression of rather consistent forms of texts and tunesa sharp contrast to the highly variable and often improvised nature of work-based shanty singing .
another effect , due to the fact that most folk performers sang shanties along with other genres , is that shanty repertoire was ever more incorporated within the generic fold of `` folk song , '' and their distinctive use , manner of performance , and identity were co-opted .
with one foot firmly planted in the world of traditional shanties , the veteran sailor and author stan hugill also became a leader ( and follower ) of trends in the folk music revival .
=== form === all shanties had a chorus of some sort , in order to allow the crew to sing all together .
many shanties had a `` call and response '' format , with one voice ( the shantyman ) singing the solo lines and the rest of the sailors bellowing short refrains in response ( compare military cadence calls ) .
the shantyman was a regular sailor who led the others in singing .
the following example , a verse of the shanty `` boney '' ( in reference to napoleon ) , shows the call and response form and the interplay between the voices of the shantyman and the crew .
when working this as a short-drag shanty ( see below ) , hands on the line would synchronize their pulls with the last syllable of each response ( in italics ) .
due to this , shanty texts might have been poor from an aesthetic standpointeven at times random nonsenseso long as the singing fit the form of the work song .
`` he went on to explain , as a rule , the chantey in its entirety possesses neither rhyme nor reason ; nevertheless , it is admirably fitted for sailors ' work .
similar to the blues , shanties often exhibited a string of such verses without much explicit or continuous theme .
songs with a fixed set of verses , or ballads , which tell a story , were not so well suited to tasks that could end abruptly at any time or that might require extending .
) many stock verses used phrases that `` floated '' between both minstrel and authentic african-american traditional songs .
drawing lyrics ( and sometimes entire songs ) from the popular and traditional repertoires of the time meant that a wide range of themes were represented .
`` a few shanties have ballad forms , such as `` the dreadnaught , '' `` the banks of newfoundland , '' and `` the golden vanitee '' , but these were relatively uncommon and required the addition of a chorus section .
however , shantymen more often adapted lyrics and themes from ballads and `` spliced '' them to existing shanty melodies and choruses .
other shanties were adapted from land-based traditional songs , for example `` billy boy '' and `` the derby ram .
=== types related to hauling actions === long-drag shanty ( also called a `` halyard shanty '' ) sung with the job of hauling on halyards to hoist , over an extended period , topsail or topgallant yards .
usually there are two pulls per chorus as in `` way , hey , blow the man down !
short-drag shanty ( also called a `` [ fore/main ] sheet shanty '' ) sung for short hauling jobs requiring a few bursts of great force , such as changing direction of sails via lines called braces , or hauling taut the corners of sails with sheets or tacks .
these are characterized by one strong pull per chorus , typically on the last word , as in `` way , haul away , haul away `` joe '' ' !
hand over hand shanty used for lighter hauling tasks , such as setting staysails and jibs or when simply hauling in the slack of a rope .
james p. barker 's singing .
bunt shanty used for `` bousing up '' ( i.e .
on vessels of war , the drum and fife or boatswain 's whistle furnish the necessary movement regulator .
=== types related to heaving actions === capstan shanty raising the anchor on a ship involved winding its rope around a capstan , a sort of giant winch , turned by sailors heaving wooden bars while walking around it .
being a continuous action , shanties sung to accompany these tasks might have longer solo verses and , frequently , a `` grand chorus , '' in addition to the call-and-response form .
windlass shanty modern shanties were used to accompany work at the patent windlass , which was designed to raise anchor and was operated by the see-saw like action of pumping hand brakes .
pump shanty because of leakage of water into the holds of wooden ships , they had to be regularly pumped out .
the frequency and monotony of this task inspired the singing of many shanties .
the ceremony involved hauling a stuffed facsimile of a horse up to the yardarm , before letting it drop into the sea , all the while singing this customary shanty .
`` off-shore whalermen in parts of the caribbean sang shanties whilst rowing their whaleboats and when hauling their catch onto land.sample : a menhaden chantey , `` wo n't you help me to raise um '' ( video ) , performed by the northern neck chantey singers of virginia .
this can be seen in the frequent lack of consensus , among different writers and informants , as to what job a given shanty was used for .
while songs with maritime themes were sung , all manner of popular songs and ballads on any subject might be sung off watch .
though those terms were not in great evidence in the 19th century , some literary references to `` fore-bitter '' and , less so , `` fo'c'sle song , '' attest to their use even prior to the appearance of `` shanty .
`` unlike shanties , during the singing of which one 's hands were occupied , sea songs might be sung to the accompaniment of handy instruments like fiddle or concertina .
`` == in languages other than english == while the crews of merchant ships in which shanties were sung might have come from a wide variety of national and ethnic backgrounds and might have spoken various mother-tongues , the shanty genre was by and large an english-language phenomenon .
there are notable bodies of shanty repertoire in swedish , norwegian , dutch , french , and welsh , and shanties have been translated into polish and german .
swedish uses sjmansvisa , `` sailor song , '' as a broad category , but tends to use the borrowed `` shanty '' to denote a work song .
similarly , norwegian uses sjmannsvise as the broad category and the borrowed term sjanti ( also spelled `` shanty '' ) or the native oppsang for work songs .
the equivalents in german are seemannslied and , again , shanty .
a shanty in polish is szanta .
== performance today == historically , shanties were usually not sung outside of work contexts , and singing sea songs was generally the purview of sailors .
==== north america ==== in north america , enthusiasts may gather at regularly scheduled , open singing sessions , for example the `` chantey sings '' held monthly aboard the ship balclutha in san francisco or weekly in gloucester , massachusetts .
at these sessions , any participant is free to start up and lead a shanty , which the rest of those presentsometimes over one hundred or more participantsjoin on the choruses .
the gatherings aim for an inclusive atmosphere that welcomes people of all ages , genders , ethnicities , and singing abilities .
north american professionals often perform solo or in very small groups , frequently using instruments .
`` professional performers tend to be in larger groups with a more substantial chorus , allowing for a capella performances .
polish performers of shanties favor medium-sized groups , often singing in harmony , accompanying themselves on instruments , and presenting themselves similarly to the way a rock band would .
sources for these renditions include books by folklorists and commercial recordings by shanty revival performers .
==== folk ==== the folk revival movement is one in which shanties themselves were often revived , especially as they have been viewed as a branch of heritage traditional songs of anglophone culture .
this is evidenced in the popular folk music fake book rise up singing , which includes such shanties as `` blow the man down , '' `` what shall we do with a drunken sailor , '' and `` bound for south australia .
for example , bruce springsteen 's `` pay me my money down '' derives from the interpretation by the folk group the weavers , who in turn found it among the collected shanties once traditionally performed by residents of the georgia sea islands .
for example , the pogues recorded `` poor paddy [ works on the railway ] '' in the arrangement of folk group the dubliners , ostensibly because of the irish connection .
malcolm arnold 's `` three shanties '' for woodwind quintet ( 1943 ) develops motifs from `` drunken sailor , '' `` boney was a warrior , '' and `` johnny come down to hilo .
the purpose and parameters of shanty singing in the present era have had an influence on which shanties are sung and how .
performers who favor a `` traditional '' style do not necessarily believe they are replicating the exact style of shanty singing of the 19th century .
these may include a loud or full voice , an emphatic , stridenteven harshtone ( as if to carry over the noise of wind and waves ) , and tempos and rhythms that are reasonably conducive to working .
they often perform a capella or only with light instrumentation typical of sailors ( e.g .
in general , performances may be more `` rough around the edges '' and be of variable length to accommodate impromptu changes in verses .
they tend to be more interested in the songs themselves and less in the `` shanty style '' of performance , in favor of music that may be considered more pleasant , less rough , and with more variation and interest than traditional shanties offer .
their rhythms may be syncopated and quite different from work song rhythms , relying on the instruments to keep time rather than the voice .
some of the preferred characteristics are smooth , pop-style vocal timbre , carefully worked out harmony , and engaging rhythms .
in redburn : his first voyage , for example , melville wrote : i soon got used to this singing ; for the sailors never touched a rope without it .
the shanty genre was unfamiliar to much of the lay public until it was publicized in the 1880s , however , so most of the popular references in fiction do not begin until that decade .
much of the historical shanty repertoire , being by definition designed to suit work , is less attractive as entertainment listening .
the musical forms were highly repetitive , and the lyrics were quite often doggerel without any cohesive or preconceived composition .
==== popular musical interpretations of traditional repertoire ==== music performers with no strong links to maritime music have interpreted traditional shanty and sea song compositions , of which widely scattered instances abound .
for example , the bawdy sea song `` frigging in the rigging '' was recorded by the punk band sex pistols .
and so , looking back to these performers , later irish-oriented rock groups like the pogues interpreted traditional shanties and sea songs like `` south australia '' and `` the greenland whale fisheries .
`` a notable instance where many non-maritime music performers tackled the traditional maritime repertoire stems from the actor johnny depp 's reported interest in shanties that developed while filming pirates of the caribbean .
==== new compositions in `` shanty '' style ==== the musical style of shanties has also inspired new musical compositions , ranging from those designed to imitate 19th century song-style to those merely intended to evoke seafaring culture through evocative phrases and token musical features .
for example , the stan rogers song , `` barrett 's privateers '' , being sung in a traditional style and having lyrics that relate an anecdote of maritime history , makes a convincing sea ballad and has been adopted into the repertoire of maritime music performers .
another newly composed song by folk singer steve goodman , `` lincoln park pirates , '' uses the phrase , `` way , hey , tow 'em away , '' imitating shanty choruses while at the same time anachronistically evoking the `` piracy '' in its subject .
`` the theme to gilligan 's island was also inspired by shanty structure and style .
`` the only characteristic it appears to share with the shanty genre is a 6/8 meter ( displayed by some well known shanties like `` blow the man down '' ) .

== history == sole started listening to rap in second and third grade after hearing a song in a movie , which made him want to write rhymes himself .
in middle school , a kid down the street had a karaoke machine and they would make loops by rewinding the tape .
in 2000 , sole released the first official solo album bottle of humans on anticon .
sole 's second solo album selling live water was released in 2003 and received positive reviews ; pitchfork media gave it a 7.3 , metacritic gave it a score of 77 and a user score of 9.5 out of 10 .
two years later , he released the third solo album live from rome in 2005 .
as he is no longer with anticon , sole currently self-releases his solo records .
his verses are often filled with abstraction , metaphor and sarcasm while avoiding or deconstructing traditional hip hop topics and cliches .
these visually intense performances prompted critics to compare the group to pink floyd .
== history == === 19881990 : paterson & cauty === alex paterson began his music career in the early 1980s as a roadie for the post-punk rock band killing joke , for whom his childhood friend martin `` youth '' glover plays bass .
paterson and cauty 's first release was a 1988 acid house anthem track , `` tripping on sunshine '' , released on the german record compilation eternity project one .
after spending a weekend of making what paterson described as `` really shit drum sounds '' , the duo decided to abandon beat-heavy music and instead work on music for after-hours listening by removing the percussion tracks .
the culmination of the group 's musical work came toward the end of the same year when they recorded a session for john peel on bbc radio 1 .
the track , then known as `` loving you , '' was largely improvisational and featured a wealth of sound effects and samples from science fiction radio plays , nature sounds , and minnie riperton 's `` lovin ' you .
following the split , paterson began working with youth on the track `` little fluffy clouds '' .
the signature of the piece centres around the repeated phrases sampled from the voice of singer/songwriter rickie lee jones , her spaced-out childlike ramble taken from a promotional cd released by geffen records for her 1989 flying cowboys cd .
assisting with the recording was bassist jah wobble , keyboardist miquette giraudy , and guitarist hillage .
despite its playing time of almost 40 minutes , `` blue room '' entered the british charts at # 12 and peaked at # 8 , making it the longest track to reach the charts .
u.f.orb reached # 1 on the british album charts to the shock of critics , who were surprised that fans had embraced what journalists considered to be progressive rock .
ffwd released a single self-titled album on paterson 's inter-modo label , which fehlmann later described as `` an orb track which became so long that it became a whole album ! ''
though orblivion was recorded in may 1996 , it was not released until almost a year later , due to island records ' desire to promote it as a follow up to u2 's techno-rock album pop .
upon release , critics noted that cydonia merged pop , trance , and ambient-dub music , which they felt to be a conglomeration of bland vocals and uninventive ambience that lacked the appeal of the orb 's earlier work .
a track `` chocolate fingers '' was uploaded onto the label 's myspace profile .
in march 2010 internet station dandelion radio broadcast a seventeen and a half minute long orb session track by patterson and fehlmann on the andrew morrison show .
the orb released the metallic spheres album in october 2010 , featuring david gilmour of pink floyd .
the orb 's central figure , alex paterson , had early musical tastes and influences which included king tubby , alice cooper , prince , kraftwerk , and t.rex .
while in brixton with martin glover as a teenager , paterson was also exposed to a large amount of reggae music , such as the mighty diamonds , the abyssinians , and bob marley .
the reggae influence on paterson and the orb can readily be heard in tracks such as the single `` perpetual dawn '' and u.f.orb 's `` towers of dub '' .
the orb have often been described as `` the pink floyd of the nineties '' , but paterson has stated that their music is more influenced by experimental electronic music than progressive rock of the 1970s .
he has noted though that the pink floyd album meddle was influential to him as a child in the 1970s .
because of their use of psychedelic images at shows , the orb 's shows are frequently compared to those of pink floyd , who also used in-show imagery and films .
for their next album , the orb poked fun at their pink floyd comparisons with the cover of live 93 featuring a floating stuffed sheep over the battersea power station , which had appeared on the cover of pink floyd 's animals .
due to paterson 's focus on science fiction and astronomical phenomena , the guardian described paterson as `` pop [ music ] 's primary spokesperson on aliens '' .
the tape machines held individual chords , rhythms , and basslines for each composition , allowing the orb to reprocess them and mimic the act of dj-ing .
their shows in the early 1990s would often be three hours of semi-improvised , continuous music featuring a wealth of triggered samples , voices , and pre-recorded tracks which were barely identifiable as the original piece .
the orb played for late night raves on the first two nights of woodstock '94 in addition to artists including aphex twin , orbital , and deee-lite .
conversely , the orb 's remixes typically use only small sections of the original track , most notably in the case of their single `` toxygene '' .
the orb 's remix of nine inch nails ' `` the perfect drug '' , too , was described as `` silly '' , as they made it sound like trent reznor was `` drowning in his bathtub '' .
inspired by the energy of punk rock but feeling the music to be too conservative , the group drew influence from the avant-garde , black music styles such as free jazz and dub , and radical political traditions .

vijay prashad 's 2002 book , `` fat cats and running dogs '' starts with a quote from the coup 's `` fat cats and bigga fish '' as an obvious nod to the inspiration for the title of the book .
the 2013 book `` party music '' , by rickey vincent , was inspired by the concept of the coup 's 2001 album `` party music '' and discussions that the author had with boots riley about the subject .
the book is a history of `` the lumpen '' , the black panther party 's funk band .

they evolved from the medieval ensembles of trumpets and drums , and in the ensembles of trumpets and timpani which were formerly common in the mounted bands of cavalry regiments .
incorporated in mounted bands since the 12th century , timpani and trumpets or bugles were , from the middle of the 15th century , employed to motivate mounted troops in battle as well as on parade .
today several ensembles in france and germany use brass instruments in addition to the standard instrumentation as well as the multiple tenor drum .
only a few bands are active in the armed forces of the netherlands today , as well as the affiliated ensembles sporting similar instrumentation , due to budget cuts in the military .
bass drums , cymbals , glockenspiels and timpani are sometimes added or are also permanent parts of the band instrumentation .

comic opera denotes a sung dramatic work of a light or comic nature , usually with a happy ending .
forms of comic opera first developed in late 17th-century italy .
by the 1730s , a new operatic genre , opera buffa , emerged as an alternative to opera seria .
it quickly made its way to france , where it became opra bouffon , and eventually , in the following century , french operetta , with jacques offenbach as its most accomplished practitioner .
many countries developed their own genres of comic opera , incorporating the italian and french models along with their own musical traditions .
examples include viennese operetta , german singspiel , spanish zarzuela , russian comic opera , english ballad opera , and savoy opera .
== italian comic opera == in late 17th-century italy , light-hearted musical plays began to be offered as an alternative to weightier opera seria ( 17th-century italian opera based on classical mythology ) .
il trespolo tutore ( 1679 ) by alessandro stradella ( 16391682 ) was an early precursor of opera buffa .
the opera has a farcical plot , and the characters of the ridiculous guardian trespolo and the maid despina are prototypes of characters widely used later in the opera buffa genre .
the form began to flourish in naples with alessandro scarlatti 's il trionfo dell'onore ( 1718 ) .
neapolitan and then italian comic opera grew into an independent form and became the most popular form of staged entertainment in italy from about 1750 to 1800 .
, you could even enjoy the overture as an independent orchestral piece ) .
although originally reserved for less serious works , the term opra comique came to refer to any opera that included spoken dialogue , including works such as bizet 's carmen that are not `` comic '' in any sense of the word .
florimond herv ( 18251892 ) is credited as the inventor of french opra bouffe , or oprette .
working on the same model , jacques offenbach ( 18191880 ) quickly surpassed him , writing over ninety operettas .
though generally well crafted and full of humorous satire and grand opera parodies , plots and characters in his works were often interchangeable .
given the frenetic pace at which he worked , offenbach sometimes used the same material in more than one opera .
== german singspiel and viennese operetta == the singspiel developed in 18th-century vienna and spread throughout austria and germany .
as in the french opra comique , the singspiel was an opera with spoken dialogue , and usually a comic subject , such as mozart 's die entfhrung aus dem serail ( 1782 ) .
19th century viennese operetta was built on both the singspiel and the french model .
johann strauss ii ( 18251899 ) , the `` waltz king '' , contributed die fledermaus ( 1874 ) and the gypsy baron ( 1885 ) .
carl millcker ( 18421899 ) a long-time conductor at the theater an der wien , also composed some of the most popular viennese operettas of the late 19th century , including der bettelstudent ( 1882 ) , gasparone ( 1884 ) and der arme jonathan ( 1890 ) .
== spanish zarzuela == zarzuela , introduced in spain in the 17th century , is rooted in popular spanish traditional musical theatre .
it alternates between spoken and sung scenes , the latter incorporating dances , with chorus numbers and humorous scenes that are usually duets .
the instruments orchestra was hidden from the audience , the actors sang in harmony , and the musical composition itself was intended to evoke an emotional response .
== english light opera == england traces its light opera tradition to the ballad opera , typically a comic play that incorporated songs set to popular tunes .
richard brinsley sheridan 's the duenna ( 1775 ) , with a score by thomas linley , was expressly described as `` a comic opera '' .
eager to liberate the english stage from risqu french influences , and emboldened by the success of trial by jury , carte formed a syndicate in 1877 to perform `` light opera of a legitimate kind '' .
gilbert and sullivan were commissioned to write a new comic opera , the sorcerer , starting the series that came to be known as the savoy operas ( named for the savoy theatre , which carte later built for these works ) that included h.m.s .
the first russian comic opera was anyuta ( 1772 ) .
in the 19th century , russian comic opera was further developed by alexey verstovsky who composed more 30 opera-vaudevilles and 6 grand operas ( most of them with spoken dialogue ) .
pyotr tchaikovsky wrote a comic opera , cherevichki ( after nikolai gogol , 1885 , 1887 moscow ) .
the 21st century in russian comic opera began with the noisy premieres of two works whose genre could be described as `` opera-farce '' : tsar demyan (   )  a frightful opera performance .
the children of rosenthal (   ) , an opera in two acts by leonid desyatnikov , with a libretto by vladimir sorokin .
the staging of the opera was accompanied by juicy scandal ; however it was an enormous success .
== north american operetta == in the united states , victor herbert ( 18591924 ) was one of the first to pick up the family-friendly style of light opera that gilbert and sullivan had made popular , although his music was also influenced by the european operetta composers .
the modern american musical incorporated elements of the british and american light operas , with works like show boat and porgy and bess that explored more serious subjects and featured a tight integration among book , movement and lyrics .
in canada , oscar ferdinand telgmann and george frederick cameron composed in the gilbert and sullivan style of light opera .
the line between light opera and other recent forms is difficult to draw .
several works are variously called operettas or musicals , such as candide and sweeney todd , depending on whether they are performed in opera houses or in theaters .
those with orchestral scores are usually styled `` musicals '' , while those played on electronic instruments are often styled rock operas .

== original radio ballads == the original radio ballads were recorded for the bbc .
the trio together made eight radio ballads between 1958 and 1964 .
all eight radio ballads were released on lp , by argo records , and later on cd .
a book about the making of the radio ballads was published on the fiftieth anniversary of the first broadcast of john axon .

the following ballads were broadcast in july and august 2012 : olympia on the origins of the olympic games ; berlin which focused on the 1936 summer olympics ; munich on the 1972 summer olympics ; controversies ; going for gold ; and the marathon .
the term is common in modern small musical ensembles , such as bands that play jazz , country , blues , and rock .
in modern rock music , a rhythm guitarist specializes in rhythmic and chordal playing ( as opposed to the melodic guitar solos and lead melody lines played by the lead guitar ) , often repeating quaver ( eighth-note ) , half note or whole note chords .
in the louder genres , such as hard rock , heavy metal and punk rock , rhythm guitarists often play power chords with distortion .
rhythm guitarists often strum open chords in pop , rock , country and folk music and play barre chords in many pop and rock styles .
in some styles of music , there may be additional percussionists playing instruments such as the djembe or shakers .
some styles of music often have two electric guitarists , such as rock genres like heavy metal music and punk rock .
some styles of music use multiple keyboard instrument performers simultaneously ( e.g.
, piano and hammond organ or electric piano and synthesizer ) for a fuller sound .
modern pop , rock and jazz band rhythm sections typically consist of a drummer , a bass player , and one or more players of chordal instruments ( e.g.
, a pianist , guitarist , etc. )
in some songs or styles of music , instruments from the rhythm section may play soloistic roles on occasion ( e.g.
, improvised guitar solos or solo breaks ) or play a melodic role ( e.g.
, a rhythm guitarist may play a lyrical countermelody behind a singer or a melodic intro line before the lead vocalist starts to sing ) .
since rhythm sections are generally providing the background music for lead instruments and solo singers , rhythm sections are typically not as prominent as a singer or soloist , and music fans tend to be more aware of lead singers than rhythm section members .
some of the most accomplished rhythm sections have become famous , such as the band , the e street band and sly dunbar and robbie shakespeare ( the latter in reggae ) .
in some cases , an arranger , orchestrator or composer will provide a written-out bass part or drum part written in music notation ( the five-line staff in which the notes are round symbols with or without stems ) .
=== other roles === rhythm section members may be expected to sing backup vocals or harmony parts in some styles of music .
in some types of heavy metal music , rhythm section members ( guitar , bass , drums ) may be expected to be able to `` headbang '' ( move their head in an up and down fashion in time with the beat ) while performing .
in some groups , one rhythm section member may have other roles , such as bandleader ( e.g.
earlier jazz bands had used banjo in place of guitar , and other bass instruments such as the tuba for recording purposes prior to the advent of microphone technology in studios .
as bebop evolved , smaller jazz groups dropped the guitar , and many free jazz ensembles dropped the piano as well .
the electric bass also began to be used as an expressive solo instrument , as exemplified by the performances of jaco pastorius and stanley clarke .
in the 1970s , the main chordal rhythm instruments were often electric instruments such as the rhodes electric piano or electric clavinet , often run through effects units such as fuzz , phasers , or wah-wah pedals and amplified through loud keyboard amplifiers .
the jazz fusion rhythm section followed the lead of the rock rhythm sections of the era , and used huge banks of speakers and powerful amplifiers to create a massive sound large enough for stadium concerts .
in the later 1980s and subsequent decades , jazz fusion bands such as the chick corea elektric band used synthesizers in the rhythm section , both for chordal accompaniment and for synth bass parts .
as the 1960s progressed the term `` rhythm section '' as used in a pop music context sometimes came to refer to just the bass and drums .
for example , paul mccartney and ringo starr of the beatles were referred to as the band 's rhythm section .
electric piano or clavinet players also used effects .
in the 1980s , many rock and pop bands continued to be based around the basic rock rhythm section established by 1960s and 1970s bands : electric bass , drums , and electric guitar or keyboards .
even though electronic keyboards or organs were the standard instruments used to create sustained `` pads '' of sound ( e.g.
, held backing chords ) for ballads , with the introduction of digital delay pedals and other modern effects , electric guitars could produce similar `` pads '' or `` walls of sound '' .
the edge , the guitarist from the rock band u2 , often used delay and reverb-drenched electric guitar arpeggios to create a shimmering , sustained `` pad '' for the group .
a 1980s-era dance pop band might be backed up by a rhythm section of a synth bass , electronic drums , and various synthesizer keyboards .
in the 1980s and 1990s , the roots rock scene went in the opposite direction from dance pop ; roots rock favoured traditional instruments in the rhythm section such as acoustic piano , acoustic guitar , mandolin , and pedal steel guitar .
another 1980s-era trend that helped revive interest in acoustic instruments was the `` mtv unplugged '' style of performances , in which a rock band performs with acoustic instruments , including acoustic guitars and an acoustic bass guitar .
) , multiple keyboard players ( e.g.
, piano , hammond organ , synth ) , two instruments playing a bass role ( e.g.
, bass guitar and synth bass ) and a group of percussionists ( congas , shakers , etc .
in contrast , in reggae or funk , entire songs may be centered around the bass groove , and the bassline is very prominent in the mix .
in some types of music , such as traditional 1950s-style country music , the drummer has a rudimentary `` timekeeping '' role , and the drums are placed low in the mix by the sound engineers .
in the more experimental forms of free jazz and jazz fusion , the drummer may not play the strict `` timekeeping '' role that is associated with drums in pop music .
in jazz groups and jazz fusion bands , the rhythm section members are often called on to perform improvised solos .
in jazz , the drummer may `` trade '' short solo sections with a saxophone player or trumpet player ; this practice , nicknamed `` trading fours '' , typically involves the drummer and the horn player alternating four bar solo sections during a jazz tune .
== variants == === organ trios === in organ trios , the lower octaves of a hammond organ or electronic keyboard are used as a substitute for bass guitar or double bass .
organ trios were a widely used type of jazz ensemble in the 1950s and 1960s to play hard bop .
organ trios are sometimes used in rock as well .
the doors ' keyboardist ray manzarek used a keyboard bass to play the bass lines .
manzarek , guitarist robby krieger , and drummer john densmore would act as an organ trio with the addition of singer jim morrison .
=== dixieland bands === new orleans or dixieland jazz bands occasionally use tuba , sousaphone , or bass saxophone in place of the double bass that was common in 1920s-era jazz bands .
marching bands use a mixture of brass , woodwind , and percussion instruments , because all of these instruments can be played while marching .
this distributed nature allows for rhythmic continuity while players take turns highlighting the melody .
in some bands , there may be no bass playerthe basslines may be played by the piano player , synth player , or guitarist .
using a guitar player to provide basslines is particularly effective if a guitar player has a seven-string guitar with a low `` b '' string .
side projects can later become full-time endeavours , but should not be confused with quitting a band for a solo career or another band .
peter hartlaub of san francisco chronicle called the solo side project `` the biggest longshot bet in mainstream music '' .
== overview == one example of musical side projects is kiss 's decision in 1978 to have each member of the band , gene simmons , paul stanley , ace frehley and peter criss , simultaneously release solo albums .
in 1992 , the melvins released solo eps in a similar fashion .
an example of this type of side project would be the band weezer , who is also the nirvana cover band goat punishment .

though kenton was to have several pop hits from the early 1940s into the 1960s , much like earlier band leader paul whiteman he categorized his music as forward looking .
he attended bell high school ; his high school yearbook book picture has the prophetic notation `` old man jazz .
`` kenton had started learning piano as a teen from a local pianist and organist frank hurst .
his mother had tried to give him piano lessons earlier but he was not interested until hearing jazz records .
at the age of 16 he was already playing a regular solo piano gig at a local hamburger eatery for 50 cents a night plus tips ; during that time he had his own performing group named `` the bell-tones .
`` his first arrangement was written during this time for a local , eight piece band who played in nearby long beach .
once he departed from gus arnheim 's group , kenton went back to study with private teachers on both the piano and in composition .
kenton would also go onto working on the nbc house band and in various hollywood studios and clubs .
producer george avakian took notice of kenton during this time while he worked as the pianist and assistant musical director at the earl carroll theatre restaurant in hollywood .
=== 1940 's === in june 1941 , kenton formed his first orchestra , which later he named after his theme song `` artistry in rhythm '' .
its decca recordings were not big sellers and a stint as bob hope 's backup radio band during the 194344 season was an unhappy experience ; les brown permanently took kenton 's place .
a popular recording of `` laura '' was made , the theme song from the film laura , and featured the voices of the band .
though the band was to have a very strong 'concert book , ' kenton also made sure the dance book was made new , fresh and contemporary .
the album climbed all the way up to # 22 on the billboard album charts and provided much needed revenue at a time when rock n roll had started to become the dominant pop music in the united states .
suite and lp stands as a watershed set of compositions for johnny richards ' career and an outstanding commercial/artistic achievement for the kenton orchestra , and a singular landmark in large ensemble latin jazz recordings .
as trombonist archie lecoque recalled of this album of very slow ballads , `` ... it was hard , but at the time we were all young and straight-ahead , we got through it and ( two ) albums came out well .
=== 1960 's === the kenton orchestra had been on a slow decline in sales and popularity in the late 1950s with having to compete with newer , popular music artists such as elvis presley , bobby darin and the platters .
there were far fewer big bands on the road and live music venues were hard to book for the kenton orchestra .
capitol producer lee gillette was trying to exploit the money making possibilities of numerous popular hits to include the 1968 musical hair featuring contemporary rock music .
two exceptions to this late 1960s period are the billboard charted single the band cut of the dragnet theme ( 1967 ) and another kenton presents release featuring the music of composer and ex-bandsman dee barton : the jazz compositions of dee barton ( 1967 ) .
he was at the vanguard of promoting jazz and jazz improvisation through his service as an educator through his stan kenton band clinics .
after kenton 's death , leslie kenton wrote a book entitled love affair .
youth crew is a music subculture of hardcore punk attributed to bands who were primarily active during the early to mid-1980s particularly during the new york hardcore scene of the late eighties .
youth crew is distinguished from other hardcore and punk scenes by its optimism and moralist outlook .
the original youth crew bands and fans were predominantly straight edge ( abstaining from alcohol and drugs ) and vegetarian advocates .
youth of today was a very thrashy youth crew band , with abrasive vocals and fast songs too short to include a lot of melody ( similar to early agnostic front , and contrasting with the other big new york city youth crew bands such as gorilla biscuits ) .
later youth crew bands took increasing influence from heavy metal .
== etymology of the term == the term crew was used by many first wave hardcore punk bands of the early 80s .
it was inspired by bands such as 7 seconds , minor threat and ssd , whose members were all straight edge , and lyrical concerns included brotherhood and community values .
the california band vegan reich established the hardline wing of straight edge youth crew hardcore .
youth crew bands were contemporary to , though noticeably distinct from , crossover thrash , thrashcore , crust punk , melodic hardcore , and emo bands .
in the 1990s , bands inspired by this scene became increasingly influenced by thrash and death metal .
the look was more conventional than a lot of punk fashion .
youth crew fashion included bleached hair , crewcuts and similar haircuts , athletic wear , letterman jackets , sportswear , army pants or shorts , oversized t-shirts bearing band logos or straight edge slogans , hooded sweatshirts and hightop basketball shoes .
1988 is often considered to be the peak of youth crew straight edge new york hardcore , so the abbreviation '88 sometimes appears in songs , t-shirts , album cover art or other media .
contemporary folk music refers to a wide variety of genres that emerged in the mid 20th century and afterwards which were associated with traditional folk music .
starting in the mid-20th century a new form of popular folk music evolved from traditional folk music .
fusion genres such as folk rock , electric folk , and others also evolved within this phenomenon .
while contemporary folk music is a genre generally distinct from traditional folk music , it often shares the same english name , performers and venues as traditional folk music ; even individual songs may be a blend of the two .
one of the earliest figures in this revival was woody guthrie , who sang traditional songs in the 1930s and 1940s as well as composing his own .
the late 1960s saw the advent of electric folk groups , a form of folk rock .
other subgenres of folk include anti folk , folk punk ( e.g.
, the irish band the pogues in the 1980s ) , indie folk , folktronica , freak folk and americana and fusion genres such as folk metal , progressive folk , psychedelic folk , and neofolk .
according to hugh blumenfeld , for the american folk scene : this is the common use of the term `` contemporary folk music '' , but is not the only case of evolution of new forms from traditional ones .
contemporary country music descends ultimately from a rural american folk tradition , but has evolved differently .
bluegrass music is a professional development of american old time music , intermixed with blues and jazz .
this is the genre that remains as `` contemporary folk music '' even when traditional music is considered to be a separate genre .
one of the earliest figures in this revival was woody guthrie , who sang traditional songs in the 1930s and 1940s as well as composing his own .
starting in 1950 , the sing out !
, broadside , and the little sandy review magazines helped spread both traditional and composed songs , as did folk-revival-oriented record companies .
bob dylan , paul simon and tom paxton visited britain for some time in the early 1960s , the first two especially making later use of the traditional english material they heard .
in 1950 , prominent american folklorist and collector of traditional songs alan lomax came to britain and met a. l. 'bert ' lloyd and ewan maccoll , a meeting credited as inaugurating the second british folk revival .
as the 1950s progressed into the 1960s , the folk revival movement gathered momentum in both britain and america .
all around the circle ( 19641975 ) showcased the traditional irish- and english-derived music of newfoundland , for example .
often newly composed songs in traditional style by writers like guthrie also featured a humorous and satirical tone .
in the 1930s guthrie traveled with migrant workers from oklahoma to california while learning , rewriting , and performing traditional folk and blues songs along the way .
during his later years guthrie served as a figurehead in the folk movement , providing inspiration to a generation of new folk musicians , including mentor relationships with ramblin ' jack elliott and bob dylan .
such songwriters as bob dylan , phil ochs , bruce springsteen , pete seeger , joe strummer and tom paxton have acknowledged their debt to guthrie as an influence .
burl ives  as a youth , ives dropped out of college to travel around as an itinerant singer during the early 1930s , earning his way by doing odd jobs and playing his banjo and guitar .
in 1930 , he had a brief , local radio career on wbow radio in terre haute , indiana , and in the 1940s he had his own radio show , titled the wayfaring stranger , titled after one of the popular ballads he sang .
the show was very popular , and in 1946 ives was cast as a singing cowboy in the film smoky .
his first book , the wayfaring stranger , was published in 1948 .
seeger had labor movement involvements , and he met guthrie at a `` grapes of wrath '' migrant workers concert on march 3 , 1940 , and the two thereafter began a musical collaboration ( which included the almanac singers ) and then formed the weavers .
`` , all three of which have been recorded by many artists both in and outside the folk revival movement and are still sung throughout the world .
in 1948 , seeger wrote the first version of his now-classic how to play the five-string banjo , an instructional book that many banjo players credit with starting them off on the instrument .
she sang water boy and performed a duet with belafonte of there 's a hole in my bucket that hit the national charts in 1961 .
odetta enjoyed a long and respected career with a repertoire of traditional songs and blues until her death in 2009 .
she was invited to perform at the premiere newport folk festival in 1959 by pop folk star bob gibson , after which baez was sometimes called `` the barefoot madonna '' , gaining renown for her clear voice and three-octave range .
she recorded her first album for a vanguard records the following year  a collection of laments and traditional folk ballads from the british isles , accompanying the songs with guitar .
the group performed a mix of creatively arranged traditional songs and contemporary numbers that frequently included satiric and political overtones .
the rooftop singers were an american progressive folk singing trio in the early 1960s , best known for the hit record `` walk right in '' .
bob dylan often performed and sometimes toured with joan baez , starting when she was a singer of mostly traditional songs .
at first , she sang traditional folk songs or songs written by others  in particular the protest songwriters of the time , such as tom paxton , phil ochs , and bob dylan .
the seekers , an australian folk and pop music group , were formed in 1962 .
these changes represented a further departure from traditional folk music .
`` were emblematic of a new term folk rock .
other performers such as simon & garfunkel and the mamas & the papas created new , hard-to-classify music that was folk-inflected and often included in discussions of folk rock .
a number of performers who had begun their careers singing largely traditional material , as typified by baez and collins , began to write their own material .
many of the acid rock bands of san francisco began by playing acoustic folk and blues .
this is a form of folk rock , with a focus on indigenous ( european , and , emblematically , english ) songs .
a key electric folk moment was the release of fairport convention 's album liege and lief .
exponents of electric folk music such as fairport convention , pentangle , alan stivell and mr. fox saw electrification of traditional musical forms as a means to reach a far wider audience .
in the british isles , the pogues in the early 1980s and ireland 's the corrs in the 1990s brought traditional tunes back into the album charts .
the corrs were active from 1990 to 2006 and performed celtic and pop music , and created a blend of the two .

this record caravelli in moscow includes 12 songs , the majority written by young pop russian composers , with a couple of traditional tunes .
later examples of early european light music include the operettas of composers such as franz von supp or sir arthur sullivan ; the continental salon and parlour music genres ; and the waltzes and marches of johann strauss ii and his family .
the straussian waltz became a common light music composition ( note for example charles ancliffe 's `` nights of gladness '' or felix godin 's `` valse septembre '' ) .
== style == the light composer ernest tomlinson has been quoted as saying that the main distinction of light music is its emphasis on melody .
the genre 's other popular title `` mood music '' is a reference to pieces such as charles williams ' a quiet stroll , which is written at an andante pace and has a jaunty , cheery feel .
eric coates ' marches in particular were popular choices as theme music .
the `` dambusters march '' , possibly his most famous work , was used as the title theme to the 1954 film and has become synonymous with the film and the mission itself .
the light composers ' skills of classical orchestration and arrangement were appreciated by composers such as john williams , with both angela morley and gordon langford asked to help orchestrate his film scores for star wars and e.t .
mitchell and webb also use acker bilk 's `` stranger on the shore '' as the theme music of their radio sketch show .

the spanish term cantes a palo seco refers to a category of flamenco palos ( musical forms ) traditionally sung a cappella or , in some cases , with some sort of percussion .
the cantias ( spanish pronunciation : [ kantias ] ) is a group of flamenco palos ( musical forms ) , originated in the area of cdiz in andalusia ( although some styles of cantia have developed in the province of seville ) .
the usual chord positions for the tonic chord in the guitar are those of e major , c major and , occasionally , a major , the latter usually reserved for solo guitar pieces .
their popularity increased at the time of the flamenco cafs cantante that became the centre of professional flamenco performances from the mid 19th century to the 1920s .

cartageneras ( spanish pronunciation : [ kartaxeneas ] ) are a flamenco palo belonging to the category of the cantes de las minas ( in english , songs of the mines ) or cantes minero-levantinos ( eastern miner songs ) .
the origin of this particular style is attributed to traditional fandango from the miner area of cartagena in the province of murcia , in southern spain .
although earlier singers like rojo el alpargatero contributed its development , it was antonio chacn who determined its definite flamenco form and made it popular in other areas .

jamrieng samai (  ) is a genre of pop music from cambodia .
the book is simplified in comparison to the lds hymn book .
the contents are divided so that different sections refer to various gospel topics for children .
there is also some prelude music for playing before sacrament meetings or in the home .
although the songs are intended primarily for children , adults in the lds church also utilize songs in the book for other purposes .
most songs that appear in either book can be sung in sacrament meeting as part of a musical program or musical number after the sacrament is delivered .
there are some songs that also have been written for use in sacrament meeting that do n't appear in either book , but are approved for use .
the choice of the vocalist with a pliant voice and repertoire of songs that would attract the attention of the audience for long hours of the concert was considered essential .
the concert is concluded with rendering of padam ( a musical composition ) , javali , and songs with national themes which would hold the attention and appreciation of the audience .
in this format the katcheris have attracted highly talented musicians in recent times and has involved hundreds of musicians in the genre of vocal music , vainikas , instrumentalists playing violin , flute and so forth .
the songs rendered in such katcheris highlight a particular raga duly informing the audience the nature of the melody which has a set of lines sung in a fixed rhythmic cycle .
the theme of the songs covers many subjects .

martinete ) are a flamenco palo belonging to the group of the tons or cantes a palo seco .
in some dance shows for the stage , though , it is accompanied by percussion played with the comps of siguiriya .
the percussion instruments chosen for this are frequently a hammer and anvil , to evocate the origins of this palo , attributed to gypsy smiths .
although martinetes are often classified under the ton group on the grounds that they share its a cappella nature , the melody types differ strongly from the rest of tons , so it is now generally considered to be a different palo .
the debla , a rather rare style , is considered by some flamenco fans as a type of martinete , while other consider it as a palo on its own .

tons ( spanish pronunciation : [ tonas ] ) is the name given to a palo or type of flamenco songs .
owing to this feature , they are considered by traditional flamencology to be the oldest surviving musical form of flamenco .
the first flamenco singer known in history , to luis el de la juliana , who lived in jerez de la frontera in the last third of the 18th century was said to have excelled in this palo .
although there were always some singers that kept singing them in private gatherings , their practical banning form the stage resulted in the total oblivion of some ton styles .
during the 1950s , with the reappraisal of purism led by singers like antonio mairena , the tons came back into use , and came to be considered as the main flamenco style together with seguiriya and sole .
the ritual celebrating the birth of guanyin was observed at the evergreen taoist church of australia , deagon to identify structure , role of participants , music forms and instrumentation .
taoists believe that music is a way to speak to the gods , to inspire religious followers and to achieve inner harmony , bringing the listener or participant closer to tao .
to follow tao is to recognise the inner harmony and balance in all living things .
music and instrumentation played a central role in this ritual .
the writings of the tao te ching support passive behaviour and promote natural harmony with nature .
the main underlying theme to the writings is the value of wu-wei , ( non-striving ) by which one returns to a primitive state closer to the tao .
these writings are considered to be influenced by buddhist ideals , confucian philosophy and traditional ancient chinese mysticism ( [ 1 ] ) .
the taoists of the evtro believe in being apart from the need of worldly possessions , and aim at creating a solidarity and harmony between heaven and man .
one way in which they hope to achieve this is by giving freely of their time in public ceremonies to help others come closer to their own inner harmony .
the entire dialogue of the ritual was intoned or sung by the priests , and these prayers were always accompanied by instrumentation ( [ 2 ] ) .
the chanting and instrumentation are used by the priests of taoism as a tool to achieving the tao ( bowker , 2000 ) .
music assists the follower on his/her path to the tao by helping to communicate with gods , reach inner harmony and come closer to finding balance with the world .
through the proper balance of yin ( female ) and yang ( male ) a taoist can find harmony and simplicity in all things ( bowker , 2000 ) .
this creates a harmony with the yang tone , by giving to the people what the yang tone gives to the gods and priests .
the ceremony started with the three priests chanting in a mono syllabic , often repeated phrase with only slight melodic deviation from the tonic .
the melodic deviation was rising in a pentatonic style chord then dropping in similar pentatonic step wise motion until the melody arrived back at the tonic , in a wave type phrase ( figure 2 ) .
most melodic phrases in the ceremony ended in descending tones , heading back to the tonic ( to gain harmony and balance , like yin-yang ) before starting the next phrase .
these rhythms , syncopations and melodic ideas all relate to the core belief of taoism , balance and harmony .
in the following of tao , each of these worshippers had their own inner harmony and this in no way intruded on the tao of the ceremony , or the tao of the priests .
the yang tone is mainly played with magical instruments such as the qing ( metal bowl ) and the faqi ( ritual percussion section ) .
by examining the role of music in taoist rituals , it is evident that instrumentation and vocalisation play central roles .
the core concept of yin-yang balance has been revealed as a theme that is acknowledged in areas of ceremony such as intonation , melodic deviation , rhythm and form .
by examining the ceremony of the birth of quan yin , at the evergreen taoist church of australia , it is clear that music is used to guide its followers and practitioners on their path to universal harmony .
rescue opera was a popular genre of opera in the late 18th and early 19th centuries in france and germany .
stylistically and thematically , rescue opera was an outgrowth of the french bourgeois opra comique ; musically , it began a new tradition that would influence german romantic opera and french grand opera .
the most famous rescue opera is ludwig van beethoven 's fidelio .
== term == '' rescue opera '' was not a contemporary term .
david charlton believes that rescue opera is not an authentic genre , and that the concept was coined to make what he believes is a nonexistent connection between beethoven 's work and french opera .
patrick j. smith , on the other hand , observes : `` the 'rescue opera ' ... antedated the revolution , but 'rescue opera ' as a genre was a product of it .
`` in french , this genre is referred to as the pice  sauvetage or opra  sauvetage , while in german it is called rettungsoper , befreiungsoper ( liberation opera ) , or schreckensoper ( terror opera ) .
these are sometimes called early rescue operas , or conversely predecessors of the rescue opera .
henri montan berton 's les rigueurs du clotre ( 1790 ) has been described as the first rescue opera ; luigi cherubini 's lodoska ( 1791 ) has also been named a founding work of the genre .
while the rescue opera was primarily a french genre , the two best-known operas in the genre are not french .
bedich smetana 's dalibor ( 1868 ) , which contains no spoken dialogue and which bears marks of wagnerian influence , has nonetheless been called a rescue opera , in part because of its political themes .
== style and themes == rescue opera was primarily a product of the french revolution .
the social changes of the period meant that opera must now appeal to the masses , and post-aristocratic , patriotic , idealistic themessuch as resistance to oppression , secularism , the political power of individuals and of people working together , and fundamental changes to the status quowere popular .
stylistically , rescue opera was an outgrowth of the opra comique , a bourgeois genre .
`` some scholars describe the plots as featuring a deus ex machina like the ones present in opera seria plots , though the resolution still bore a closer resemblance to the endings of domestic comedies .
folk songs and `` picturesque '' arias were used to indicate a setting ; lodoska , for example , set in poland , contains what may be the first polonaise in opera .
jean le sueur , whose la caverne was one of the more influential rescue operas , wrote in his score for tlmaque that arias should be sung with voix concentre or in a manner that was trs-concentr .
== impact == in its use of local color , heightened dramatic and emotional intensity , and inclusion of descriptive instrumental music , rescue opera preceded the works of german romantics such as carl maria von weber and , through him , richard wagner .
grandiosity in music and scenery , influenced by the political spectacles of the french revolution and french empire , influenced grand opera and the works of composers like giacomo meyerbeer .

the melody is described in roberton 's songs of the isles as a traditional gaelic tune , probably titled `` lochaber '' .
the tune was part of an old gaelic song , `` ran na comhachaig '' ( the 'creag ghuanach ' portion ) ; from brae lochaber .

the position was established in 1843 when queen victoria and prince albert visited the marquess of breadalbane at taymouth castle a year earlier and discovered the marquess had his own personal piper .
the art form known as opera originated in italy in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries , though it drew upon older traditions of medieval and renaissance courtly entertainment .
the word opera , meaning `` work '' in italian , was first used in the modern musical and theatrical sense in 1639 and soon spread to the other european languages .
dafne by jacopo peri was the earliest composition considered opera , as understood today , although with only five instrumental parts it was much more like a chamber opera than either the preceding intermedi or the operas of claudio monteverdi a few years later .
the members of the camerata considered that the `` chorus '' parts of greek dramas were originally sung , and possibly even the entire text of all roles ; opera was thus conceived as a way of `` restoring '' this situation .
most of the music for `` dafne '' is unfortunately lost ( the libretto was printed and survives ) , but one of peri 's many later operas , euridice , dating from 1600 , is the first opera score to have survived to the present day .
traditions of staged sung music and drama go back to both secular and religious forms from the middle ages , and at the time opera first appears the italian intermedio had courtly equivalents in various countries .
== etymology == the italian word opera means `` work '' , both in the sense of the labor done and the result produced .
the italian word in turn derives from the latin opera .
== italian origins of opera == peri 's works , however , did not arise out of a creative vacuum in the area of sung drama .
an underlying prerequisite for the creation of opera proper was the practice of monody .
monody is the solo singing/setting of a dramatically conceived melody , designed to express the emotional content of the text it carries , which is accompanied by a relatively simple sequence of chords rather than other polyphonic parts .
from this , it was only a small step to fully-fledged monody .
the solo madrigal , frottola , villanella and their kin featured prominently in the intermedio or intermezzo , theatrical spectacles with music that were funded in the last seventy years of the 16th century by the opulent and increasingly secular courts of italy 's city-states .
like the later opera , an intermedi featured the aforementioned solo singing , but also madrigals performed in their typical multi-voice texture , and dancing accompanied by the present instrumentalists .
another popular court entertainment at this time was the `` madrigal comedy '' , later also called `` madrigal opera '' by musicologists familiar with the later genre .
there were also two staged musical `` pastoral '' s , il satiro and la disperazione di fileno , both produced in 1590 and written by emilio de ' cavalieri .
other pastoral plays had long included some musical numbers ; one of the earliest , la fabula d'orfeo ( 1480 ) by poliziano had at least three solo songs and one chorus .
this led to the dominance of ballet in opera of the french tradition .
== the first german opera == dafne ( opitz-schtz ) 1627 was the first singspiel , though staden 's seelewig is the first surviving german opera .
== the first english opera == in england the masque tradition was too strongly associated with the court of charles i to survive the outbreak of the english civil war .
this lack of financial backing , and the thriving english tradition of incidental music , made it difficult for italian-style opera to take hold there .
whether these are to be regarded as possible progenitors of opera is highly debatable .
a new , 17th century form of religious drama , the oratorio did arise shortly after the advent of opera , though it owes at least as much to the ( originally secular ) non-dramatic recitative-aria form of the cantata .
=== secular === the origins of opera clearly lie in the court , whereas the mystery plays were normally a bourgeois form , entrusted to the guilds .
he also believed that voice production had been eastern and folksy ; in european religious paintings , angels were frequently depicted singing with tightened throats and mouths barely open .

patience and sarah is a 1998 opera by paula m. kimper .
it has been described as the first lesbian opera and as the first mainstream gay-themed opera .
== history == persons began writing the libretto in 1981 , after a lesbian opera singer , upon whom persons had a crush , mentioned that she had trouble identifying with the straight characters she played .
miller gave the pair permission to adapt her novel as an opera , and signed over the rights shortly before she died in 1996 .
kimper and persons cite richard strauss as an influence , and mention that their wish to make the opera `` economically viable to produce '' led to their choice of a small orchestra and no chorus .
a semi-staged final version , accompanied by piano , was performed in july 1996 .
many lesbians , who unlike gay men are not known for opera patronage , attended , as well as other first-time operagoers .
the opera has been performed a number of times , in full stagings or in excerpts , in other locations .
`` i want to live , '' patience and sarah 's act ii duet , appears on lesbian american composers , the third album in composers recordings , inc. 's `` gay american composers '' series .

anthony tommasini of the times , reviewing the 1998 premiere , criticized kimper 's romantic touches and said that the opera 's `` strongest musical moments were when it sounded like [ the folk opera kimper described it as ] , especially the set-piece hymns and songs .
`` kozinn and jorden both observed that the opera was too long .

it was partially borne out of an attempt to distinguish kuti 's music from the `` soul music '' of american artists such as james brown .

like his father , woody guthrie , he is known for singing songs of protest against social injustice .
guthrie 's best-known work is his debut piece , `` alice 's restaurant massacree '' , a satirical talking blues song about 18 minutes in length that has since become a thanksgiving anthem .
he spent the summer of 1965 in london , eventually meeting karl dallas , who connected guthrie with london 's folk rock scene and became a lifelong friend of his .
this littering charge would soon serve as the basis for guthrie 's most famous work , `` alice 's restaurant massacree '' , a talking blues song that lasts 18 minutes and 34 seconds in its original recorded version .
although the band received good reviews , it never gained the popularity that guthrie did while playing solo .
this band is not to be confused with the popular country music group shenandoah , an entirely different group that had musical hits from 1986 to 2006 .
however , that album , like guthrie 's earlier warner bros. records albums , is rarely heard today even though each contains strong folk and folk rock music accompanied by widely regarded musicians such as ry cooder .
many ballads were written and sold as single sheet broadsides .
the form was often used by poets and composers from the 18th century onwards to produce lyrical ballads .
as a narrative song , their theme and function may originate from scandinavian and germanic traditions of storytelling that can be seen in poems such as beowulf .
most northern and west european ballads are written in ballad stanzas or quatrains ( four-line stanzas ) of alternating lines of iambic ( an unstressed followed by a stressed syllable ) tetrameter ( eight syllables ) and iambic trimeter ( six syllables ) , known as ballad meter .
scottish ballads in particular are distinctively un-english , even showing some pre-christian influences in the inclusion of supernatural elements such as the fairies in the scottish ballad `` tam lin '' .
the ballads do not have any known author or correct version ; instead , having been passed down mainly by oral tradition since the middle ages , there are many variations of each .
the ballads remained an oral tradition until the increased interest in folk songs in the 18th century led collectors such as bishop thomas percy to publish volumes of popular ballads .
in all traditions most ballads are narrative in nature , with a self-contained story , often concise , and rely on imagery , rather than description , which can be tragic , historical , romantic or comic .
themes concerning rural laborers and their sexuality are common , and there are many ballads based on the robin hood legend .
another common feature of ballads is repetition , sometimes of fourth lines in succeeding stanzas , as a refrain , sometimes of third and fourth lines of a stanza and sometimes of entire stanzas .
communalists tend to see more recent , particularly printed , broadside ballads of known authorship as a debased form of the genre , while individualists see variants as corruptions of an original text .
== transmission == the transmission of ballads comprises a key stage in their re-composition .
according to scott , transcribed ballads often have a 'flatness and insipidity ' compared to their oral counterparts .
== classification == european ballads have been generally classified into three major groups : traditional , broadside and literary .
in america a distinction is drawn between ballads that are versions of european , particularly british and irish songs , and 'native american ballads ' , developed without reference to earlier songs .
a further development was the evolution of the blues ballad , which mixed the genre with afro-american music .
for the late 19th century the music publishing industry found a market for what are often termed sentimental ballads , and these are the origin of the modern use of the term 'ballad ' to mean a slow love song .
=== traditional ballads === the traditional , classical or popular ( meaning of the people ) ballad has been seen as beginning with the wandering minstrels of late medieval europe .
from the end of the 15th century there are printed ballads that suggest a rich tradition of popular music .
a reference in william langland 's piers plowman indicates that ballads about robin hood were being sung from at least the late 14th century and the oldest detailed material is wynkyn de worde 's collection of robin hood ballads printed about 1495 .
both northern english and southern scots shared in the identified tradition of border ballads , including what is often said to be the finest , 'the ballad of chevy chase ' , thought to have been composed by the lancashire-born sixteenth-century minstrel richard sheale .
it has been suggested that the increasing interest in traditional popular ballads during the eighteenth century was prompted by social issues such as the enclosure movement as many of the ballads deal with themes concerning rural laborers .
james davey has suggested that the common themes of sailing and naval battles may also have prompted the use ( at least in england ) of popular ballads as naval recruitment tools .
key work on the traditional ballad was undertaken in the late 19th century in denmark by svend grundtvig and for england and scotland by the harvard professor francis james child .
they attempted to record and classify all the known ballads and variants in their chosen regions .
since child died before writing a commentary on his work it is uncertain exactly how and why he differentiated the 305 ballads printed that would be published as the english and scottish popular ballads .
there have been many different and contradictory attempts to classify traditional ballads by theme , but commonly identified types are the religious , supernatural , tragic , love ballads , historic , legendary and humorous .
the traditional form and content of the ballad were modified to form the basis for twenty-three bawdy pornographic ballads that appeared in the underground victorian magazine the pearl , which ran for eighteen issues between 1879 and 1880 .
unlike the traditional ballad , these obscene ballads aggressively mocked sentimental nostalgia and local lore .
=== broadsides === broadside ballads ( also known as 'broadsheet ' , 'stall ' , 'vulgar ' or 'come all ye ' ballads ) were a product of the development of cheap print in the 16th century .
in their heyday of the first half of the 17th century , they were printed in black-letter or gothic type and included multiple , eye-catching illustrations , a popular tune title , as well as an alluring poem .
by the 18th century , they were printed in white letter or roman type and often without much decoration ( as well as tune title ) .
the subject matter varied from what has been defined as the traditional ballad , although many traditional ballads were printed as broadsides .
=== literary ballads === literary or lyrical ballads grew out of an increasing interest in the ballad form among social elites and intellectuals , particularly in the romantic movement from the later 18th century .
respected literary figures like robert burns and sir walter scott in scotland both collected and wrote their own ballads , using the form to create an artistic product .
rather than the more aristocratic themes and music of the italian opera , the ballad operas were set to the music of popular folk songs and dealt with lower-class characters .
subject matter involved the lower , often criminal , orders , and typically showed a suspension ( or inversion ) of the high moral values of the italian opera of the period .
ballad opera was attempted in america and prussia .
later it moved into a more pastoral form , like isaac bickerstaffe 's love in a village ( 1763 ) and shield 's rosina ( 1781 ) , using more original music that imitated , rather than reproduced , existing ballads .
the term ballad opera has also been used to describe musicals using folk music , such as the martins and the coys in 1944 , and peter bellamy 's the transports in 1977 .
the satiric elements of ballad opera can be seen in some modern musicals such as chicago and cabaret .
== beyond europe == === native american ballads === native american ballads are ballads that are native to north america ( not to be confused with ballads performed by native americans ) .
some 300 ballads sung in north america have been identified as having origins in british traditional or broadside ballads .
blues ballads tend to deal with active protagonists , often anti-heroes , resisting adversity and authority , but frequently lacking a strong narrative and emphasising character instead .
they were often accompanied by banjo and guitar which followed the blues musical format .
the most famous blues ballads include those about john henry and casey jones .
=== bush ballads === the ballad was taken to australia by early settlers from britain and ireland and gained particular foothold in the rural outback .
the rhyming songs , poems and tales written in the form of ballads often relate to the itinerant and rebellious spirit of australia in the bush , and the authors and performers are often referred to as bush bards .
the 19th century was the golden age of bush ballads .
== sentimental ballads == sentimental ballads , sometimes called `` tear-jerkers '' or `` drawing-room ballads '' owing to their popularity with the middle classes , had their origins in the early `` tin pan alley '' music industry of the later 19th century .
they were generally sentimental , narrative , strophic songs published separately or as part of an opera ( descendants perhaps of broadside ballads , but with printed music , and usually newly composed ) .
modern variations include `` jazz ballads '' , `` pop ballads '' and `` power ballads '' .

== history == === origins === the roots of modern bhangra music date back to the early 1980s , when several punjabi bands started experimenting with western styles as well as traditional punjabi music .
this was the first song to combine traditional asian music with modern western instruments , which would be followed by further developments of this in bhangra .
the new genre quickly became popular in britain replacing punjabi folk singers due to it being heavily influenced in britain by the infusion of rock music and a need to move away from the simple and repetitive punjabi folk music .
the primary emphasis during these times was on the melody/riff , played out usually on a synthesizer , harmonium , accordion or a guitar .
he attended the lyallpur khalsa college , jalandhar , in punjab in 1980 to study for a bachelor of arts degree .
there he met his mentor , professor inderjit singh , who taught him punjabi folk singing and bhangra dancing .
these albums are notable for being amongst the first bhangra albums to mix punjabi drums and punjabi synthesizers with traditional british instruments successfully .
bands like alaap and heera incorporated rock-influenced beats into bhangra , because it enabled `` asian youth to affirm their identities positively '' within the broader environment of alternative rock as an alternative way of expression .
some asian artists , such as bally sagoo , talvin singh , badmarsh , black star liner are creating their own form of british hip-hop .
=== folk backlash === in the mid 1990s , however , many artists returned to the original , traditional folk beats away from bhangra music , often incorporating more dhol drum beats and tumbi .
they were aided by djs who mixed hip hop samples with folk singing .
beginning around 1994 , there was a trend towards the use of samples ( often sampled from mainstream hip hop ) mixed with traditional folk rhythm instruments , such as the tumbi and dhol .
using folk instruments and hip-hop samples , along with relatively inexpensive folk vocals imported from punjab , punjabi folk music was able to cause the decline of bhangra music .
folk vocals are usually sung to traditional melodies , that are often repeated with new lyrics .
some south asian djs , especially in america , have mixed punjabi folk music with house , reggae , and hip-hop to add a different flavor to punjabi folk .
this movement was established and proliferated by djs such as punjabi mc and dj rekha .
daler mehndi , a punjabi singer from india has a type of music known as `` folk pop '' .
in 2001 , punjabi folk , and its hip-hop form , folkhop , began to exert an influence over us r & b music , when missy elliott released the folkhop-influenced song `` get ur freak on '' .
american singer and actress selena gomez released her bhangra single come & get it from her first solo album stars dance in 2013 .
the lyrics are tributes to the cultural traditions of punjab .
the string instruments include the guitar ( both acoustic and electrical ) , bass , oud , sitar , tumbi , violin and sarangi .
pandit dinesh and kuljit bhamra were trained exponents of indian percussion and helped create the current british music , mainly with tabla and dholki for bands like alaap and heera .
another reason why some fans express an anti-folk sentiment is because many folk songs were written about sikh jatts whereas other punjabi sikhs were not jatt , so they disapproved of punjabi folk music .
black sabbath were an english rock band , formed in birmingham in 1968 , by guitarist and main songwriter tony iommi , bassist and main lyricist geezer butler , singer ozzy osbourne , and drummer bill ward .
black sabbath are often cited as pioneers of heavy metal music .
formed in 1968 as the polka tulk blues band , a blues rock band , the group went through line up changes , renamed themselves as earth , broke up and reformed .
by 1969 , they had named themselves black sabbath after the film black sabbath starring boris karloff , and began incorporating occult themes with horror-inspired lyrics and tuned-down guitars .
the band 's first show as black sabbath took place on 30 august 1969 , in workington .
their debut album , black sabbath , was released on friday the 13th , february 1970 , on philips ' newly formed progressive rock label , vertigo records .
following two albums with dio , black sabbath endured many personnel changes in the 1980s and 1990s that included vocalists ian gillan , glenn hughes , ray gillen and tony martin , as well as several drummers and bassists .
iommi has stated that he has not ruled out the possibility of new material or one-off shows under the black sabbath name .
== history == === formation and early days ( 19681969 ) === following the break-up of their previous band mythology in 1968 , guitarist tony iommi and drummer bill ward sought to form a heavy blues rock band in aston , birmingham .
a cinema across the street from the band 's rehearsal room was showing the 1963 horror film black sabbath starring boris karloff and directed by mario bava .
judas priest frontman rob halford has called the track `` probably the most evil song ever written '' .
inspired by the new sound , the band changed their name to black sabbath in august 1969 , and made the decision to focus on writing similar material , in an attempt to create the musical equivalent of horror films .
=== black sabbath and paranoid ( 19701971 ) === the band 's first show as black sabbath took place on 30 august 1969 , in workington .
later releases were handled by philips ' newly formed progressive rock label , vertigo records .
black sabbath 's first major exposure came when the band appeared on john peel 's top gear radio show in 1969 , performing `` black sabbath '' , `` n.i.b .
ozzy was singing at the same time , we just put him in a separate booth and off we went .
`` black sabbath was released on friday the 13th , february 1970 , and reached number 8 in the uk albums chart .
to capitalise on their chart success in the us , the band returned to the studio in june 1970 , just four months after black sabbath was released .
`` the single was released in september 1970 and reached number four on the uk charts , remaining black sabbath 's only top ten hit .
the us release was held off until january 1971 , as the black sabbath album was still on the charts at the time of paranoid 's uk release .
although the single failed to reach the top 40 , `` iron man '' remains one of black sabbath 's most popular songs , as well as the band 's highest charting us single until 1998 's `` psycho man '' .
master of reality contained black sabbath 's first acoustic songs , alongside fan favourites such as `` children of the grave '' and `` sweet leaf '' .
the only criterion is excitement , and black sabbath 's got it '' .
following the master of reality world tour in 1972 , black sabbath took its first break in three years .
the record company changed the title at the last minute to black sabbath vol .
with more time in the studio , the album saw the band starting to experiment with new textures , such as strings , piano , orchestration and multi-part songs .
=== sabbath bloody sabbath and sabotage ( 19731976 ) === following the volume 4 world tour , black sabbath returned to los angeles to begin work on their next release .
yes keyboardist rick wakeman was brought in as a session player , appearing on `` sabbra cadabra '' .
in november 1973 , black sabbath began to receive positive reviews in the mainstream press after the release of sabbath bloody sabbath , with gordon fletcher of rolling stone calling the album `` an extraordinarily gripping affair '' , and `` nothing less than a complete success .
`` later reviewers such as allmusic 's eduardo rivadavia cite the album as a `` masterpiece , essential to any heavy metal collection '' , while also displaying `` a newfound sense of finesse and maturity .
attracting over 200,000 fans , black sabbath appeared alongside popular 1970s rock and pop bands deep purple , eagles , emerson , lake & palmer , rare earth , seals & crofts , black oak arkansas , and earth , wind & fire .
the move caused a contractual dispute with black sabbath 's former management , and while on stage in the us , osbourne was handed a subpoena that led to two years of litigation .
we took a look at ourselves , and we wanted to do a rock album  sabbath , bloody sabbath was n't a rock album , really .
`` produced by black sabbath and mike butcher , sabotage was released in july 1975 .
during the recording of technical ecstasy , osbourne admits that he began losing interest in black sabbath and began to consider the possibility of working with other musicians .
the album featured less of the doomy , ominous sound of previous efforts , and incorporated more synthesisers and uptempo rock songs .
touring in support of technical ecstasy began in november 1976 , with openers boston and ted nugent in the us , and completed in europe with ac/dc in april 1977 .
iommi called vocalist dave walker , a longtime friend of the band , who had previously been a member of fleetwood mac and savoy brown , and informed him that osbourne had left the band .
walker , who was at that time fronting a band called mistress , flew to birmingham from california in late 1977 to write material and rehearse with black sabbath .
on 8 january 1978 , black sabbath made their only live performance with walker on vocals , playing an early version of the song `` junior 's eyes '' on the bbc television programme `` look !
`` walker later recalled that while in birmingham he had bumped into osbourne in a pub and came to the conclusion that osbourne was not fully committed to leaving black sabbath .
osbourne initially set out to form a solo project featuring former dirty tricks members john frazer-binnie , terry horbury , and andy bierne .
as the new band were in rehearsals in january 1978 , osbourne had a change of heart and rejoined black sabbath .
reviewers called black sabbath 's performance `` tired and uninspired '' , a stark contrast to the `` youthful '' performance of van halen , who were touring the world for the first time .
following the tour , black sabbath returned to los angeles and again rented a house in bel air , where they spent nearly a year working on new material for the next album .
`` alcohol was definitely one of the most damaging things to black sabbath .
`` === heaven and hell and mob rules ( 19791982 ) === sharon arden ( later sharon osbourne ) , daughter of black sabbath manager don arden , suggested former rainbow vocalist ronnie james dio to replace ozzy osbourne in 1979 .
with a notably different vocal style from osbourne 's , dio 's addition to the band marked a change in black sabbath 's sound .
ozzy was a great showman , but when dio came in , it was a different attitude , a different voice and a different musical approach , as far as vocals .
while on tour , black sabbath 's former label in england issued a live album culled from a seven-year-old performance , titled live at last without any input from the band .
the album 's title track `` the mob rules '' , which was recorded at john lennon 's old house in england , also featured in the 1981 animated film heavy metal , although the film version is an alternate take , and differs from the album version .
butler also accused dio and appice of working on a solo album during the album 's mixing without telling the other members of black sabbath .
ronnie james dio left black sabbath in november 1982 to start his own band , and took drummer vinny appice with him .
the band settled on former deep purple vocalist ian gillan to replace ronnie james dio in december 1982 .
while the project was not initially set to be called black sabbath , pressures from the record label forced the group to retain the name .
the band headlined the 1983 reading festival in england , adding the deep purple song `` smoke on the water '' to their set list .
=== hiatus and seventh star ( 19841986 ) === following the completion of the born again tour in march 1984 , vocalist ian gillan left black sabbath to re-join deep purple , which was reforming after a long hiatus .
disillusioned with the band 's revolving line-up , bassist geezer butler quit black sabbath in november 1984 to form a solo band .
when we got together with gillan it was not supposed to be a black sabbath album .
after we had done the album we gave it to warner bros. and they said they were going to put it out as a black sabbath album and we did n't have a leg to stand on .
`` following butler 's exit , sole remaining original member tony iommi put black sabbath on hiatus , and began work on a solo album with long-time sabbath keyboardist geoff nicholls .
while working on new material , the original black sabbath line-up were offered a spot at bob geldof 's live aid benefit concert ; the band agreed , performing at the philadelphia show , on 13 july 1985 .
the event marked the first time the original line-up appeared on stage since 1978 , and also featured reunions of the who and led zeppelin .
returning to his solo work , iommi enlisted bassist dave spitz , drummer eric singer and initially intended to use multiple singers , including rob halford of judas priest , former deep purple and trapeze vocalist glenn hughes , and former black sabbath vocalist ronnie james dio .
glenn hughes came along to sing on one track and we decided to use him on the whole album .
warner bros. refused to release the album as a tony iommi solo release , instead insisting on using the name black sabbath .
pressured by the band 's manager , don arden , the two compromised and released the album as `` black sabbath featuring tony iommi '' in january 1986 .
`` it opened up a whole can of worms really '' , iommi explained , `` because i think if we could have done it as a solo album , it would have been accepted a lot more .
the new line-up rehearsed for six weeks preparing for a full world tour , although the band were eventually forced to use the black sabbath name .
`` i was into the 'tony iommi project ' , but i was n't into the black sabbath moniker '' , hughes said .
`` the idea of being in black sabbath did n't appeal to me whatsoever .
glenn hughes singing in black sabbath is like james brown singing in metallica .
one vocalist whose status is disputed , both inside and outside black sabbath , is christian evangelist and former joshua frontman , jeff fenholt .
fenholt has insisted that he was a singer in black sabbath between january and may 1985 .
fenholt gives a detailed account of his time with iommi and sabbath in garry sharpe-young 's book sabbath bloody sabbath : the battle for black sabbath .
=== the eternal idol , headless cross and tyr ( 19861990 ) === black sabbath began work on new material in october 1986 at air studios in montserrat with producer jeff glixman .
while working in the uk , new vocalist ray gillen abruptly left black sabbath to form blue murder with john sykes .
the band enlisted former alliance vocalist tony martin to re-record gillen 's tracks , and former electric light orchestra drummer bev bevan to complete a few percussion overdubs .
before the release of the new album black sabbath accepted an offer to play six shows at sun city , south africa during the apartheid era .
allmusic said that `` martin 's powerful voice added new fire '' to the band , and the album contained `` some of iommi 's heaviest riffs in years .
`` blender gave the album two stars , claiming the album was `` black sabbath in name only '' .
following the poor commercial performance of the eternal idol , black sabbath were dropped by both vertigo records and warner bros. records , and signed with i.r.s .
iommi enlisted former rainbow drummer cozy powell , long-time keyboardist nicholls and session bassist laurence cottle , and rented a `` very cheap studio in england '' .
black sabbath released headless cross in april 1989 , and it was also ignored by contemporary reviewers , although allmusic contributor eduardo rivadavia gave the album four stars and called it `` the finest non-ozzy or dio black sabbath album '' .
queen guitarist brian may , a good friend of iommi 's , played a guest solo on the song `` when death calls '' .
tyr was released on 6 august 1990 , reaching number 24 on the uk albums chart , but was the first black sabbath release not to break the billboard 200 in the us .
=== dehumanizer ( 19901992 ) === while on his own lock up the wolves us tour in august 1990 , former black sabbath vocalist ronnie james dio was joined on stage at the roy wilkins auditorium by former black sabbath bassist geezer butler to perform `` neon knights '' .
following the show , the two expressed interest in rejoining black sabbath .
ronnie james dio and geezer butler joined tony iommi and cozy powell in autumn of 1990 to begin working on the next black sabbath release .
anchored by the top 40 rock radio single `` tv crimes '' , the album peaked at number 44 on the billboard 200 .
additionally , the perception by many fans of a return of some semblance of the `` real '' black sabbath provided the band with some much needed momentum .
while on tour , former vocalist ozzy osbourne announced his first retirement , and invited black sabbath to open for his solo band at the final two shows of his no more tours tour in costa mesa , california .
dio quit black sabbath following a show in oakland , california on 13 november 1992 , one night before the band were set to appear at osbourne 's retirement show .
iommi and butler also joined osbourne and former drummer ward on stage for the first time since 1985 's live aid concert , performing a brief set of black sabbath songs .
=== cross purposes and forbidden ( 19931996 ) === drummer vinny appice left the band following the reunion show to join ronnie james dio 's solo band , later appearing on dio 's strange highways and angry machines .
the band returned to the studio to work on new material , although the project was not originally intended to be released under the black sabbath name .
under pressure from their record label , the band released their seventeenth studio album , cross purposes , on 8 february 1994 , under the black sabbath name .
touring in support of cross purposes began in february with morbid angel and motrhead in the us .
after the european tour with cathedral and godspeed in june 1994 , drummer bobby rondinelli quit the band and was replaced by original black sabbath drummer ward for five shows in south america .
butler formed a solo project called gzr , and released plastic planet in 1995 .
black sabbath embarked on a world tour in july 1995 with openers motrhead and tiamat , but two months into the tour , drummer cozy powell left the band , citing health issues , and was replaced by former drummer bobby rondinelli .
`` after completing asian dates in december 1995 , tony iommi put the band on hiatus , and began work on a solo album with former black sabbath vocalist glenn hughes , and former judas priest drummer dave holland .
in 1997 , tony iommi disbanded the current line-up to officially reunite with ozzy osbourne and the original black sabbath line-up .
=== reunion ( 19972006 ) === in the summer of 1997 , tony iommi , geezer butler , and ozzy osbourne officially reunited to co-headline the ozzfest festival tour alongside osbourne 's solo band .
the line-up featured osbourne 's drummer mike bordin filling in for ward , who was unable to participate because of previous commitments with his solo project , the bill ward band .
the album spawned the single `` iron man '' , which won black sabbath their first grammy award in 2000 for best metal performance , 30 years after the song was originally released .
following the ozzfest appearances , the band was put on hiatus while members worked on solo material .

while the line-up of osbourne , butler , iommi and ward were still officially called black sabbath , the new line-up opted to call themselves heaven & hell , after the album of the same name , to avoid confusion .
when asked about the name of the group , iommi stated `` it really is black sabbath , whatever we do ... so everyone knows what they 're getting [ and ] so people wo n't expect to hear 'iron man ' and all those songs .
heaven & hell toured the us with openers megadeth and machine head , and recorded a live album and dvd in new york on 30 march 2007 , titled live from radio city music hall .
in april 2008 the band announced the upcoming release of a new box set and their participation in the metal masters tour , alongside judas priest , motrhead and testament .

=== final tour , the future and disbandment ( 20142017 ) === on 29 september 2014 , osbourne told metal hammer that black sabbath would begin work on their twentieth studio album in early 2015 with producer rick rubin , followed by a final tour in 2016 .
`` on 3 september 2015 , it was announced that black sabbath would embark on their final tour , titled the end , from january 2016 to february 2017 .
despite earlier reports that they would enter the studio before their farewell tour , osbourne stated that there would not be another black sabbath studio album .
asked in november 2016 about his plans after black sabbath 's final tour , iommi replied , `` i 'll be doing some writing .
`` in an april 2017 interview , butler revealed that black sabbath considered making a blues album as the follow-up to 13 , but added that , `` the tour got in the way .

== musical style == black sabbath were a heavy metal band , whose music has also been described as psychedelic rock , blues rock , hard rock , progressive rock , proto-progressive metal , and acid rock .
early on black sabbath were influenced by cream , the beatles , fleetwood mac , jimi hendrix , john mayall & the bluesbreakers , led zeppelin and jethro tull .
although black sabbath went through many line-ups and stylistic changes , their core sound focuses on ominous lyrics and doomy music , often making use of the musical tritone , also called the `` devil 's interval '' .
much like many of their early heavy metal contemporaries , the band received virtually no airplay on rock radio .
as the band 's primary songwriter , tony iommi wrote the majority of black sabbath 's music , while osbourne would write vocal melodies , and bassist geezer butler would write lyrics .
`` on iommi 's influence , osbourne later said : black sabbath never used to write a structured song .
beginning with their third album , master of reality , black sabbath began to feature tuned-down guitars .
in 1965 , before forming black sabbath , guitarist tony iommi suffered an accident while working in a sheet metal factory , losing the tips of two fingers on his right hand .
== legacy == black sabbath has sold over 70 million records worldwide , including a riaa-certified 15 million in the us .
they are one of the most influential heavy metal bands of all time .
time magazine called paranoid `` the birthplace of heavy metal '' , placing it in their top 100 albums of all time .
rolling stone magazine ranked black sabbath number 85 in their list of the `` 100 greatest artists of all time .
mtv placed black sabbath at number one on their top ten heavy metal bands and vh1 placed them at number two on their list of the 100 greatest artists of hard rock .
vh1 ranked black sabbath 's `` iron man '' the number one song on their 40 greatest metal songs countdown .
allmusic 's william ruhlmann said : black sabbath has been so influential in the development of heavy metal rock music as to be a defining force in the style .
the group took the blues-rock sound of late '60s acts like cream , blue cheer , and vanilla fudge to its logical conclusion , slowing the tempo , accentuating the bass , and emphasising screaming guitar solos and howled vocals full of lyrics expressing mental anguish and macabre fantasies .
if their predecessors clearly came out of an electrified blues tradition , black sabbath took that tradition in a new direction , and in so doing helped give birth to a musical style that continued to attract millions of fans decades later .
according to rolling stone 's holly george-warren , `` black sabbath was the heavy metal king of the 70s .
`` although initially `` despised by rock critics and ignored by radio programmers '' , the group sold more than 8 million albums by the end of that decade .
`` lamb of god 's chris adler said : `` if anybody who plays heavy metal says that they were n't influenced by black sabbath 's music , then i think that they 're lying to you .
i think all heavy metal music was , in some way , influenced by what black sabbath did .
`` judas priest vocalist rob halford commented : `` they were and still are a groundbreaking band..you can put on the first black sabbath album and it still sounds as fresh today as it did 30-odd years ago .
`` on black sabbath 's standing , rage against the machine guitarist tom morello states : `` the heaviest , scariest , coolest riffs and the apocalyptic ozzy wail are without peer .
`` phil anselmo of pantera and down stated that `` only a fool would leave out what black sabbath brought to the heavy metal genre '' .
in addition to being pioneers of heavy metal , they also have been credited for laying the foundations for heavy metal subgenres stoner rock , sludge metal , thrash metal , black metal and doom metal as well as for alternative rock subgenre grunge .
according to the critic bob gulla , the band 's sound `` shows up in virtually all of grunge 's most popular bands , including nirvana , soundgarden , and alice in chains '' .
culturally , black sabbath have exerted a huge influence in both television and literature and have in many cases become synonymous with heavy metal .
in the film almost famous , lester bangs gives the protagonist an assignment to cover the band ( plot point one ) with the immortal line : 'give me 500 words on black sabbath ' .
contemporary music and arts publication trebuchet magazine has put this to practice by asking all new writers to write a short piece ( 500 words ) on black sabbath as a means of proving their creativity and voice on a well documented subject .
during the 1980s , several thrash and death metal bands formed a prototype for black metal .
a second wave arose in the early 1990s , spearheaded by norwegian bands such as mayhem , darkthrone , burzum , immortal , emperor , satyricon and gorgoroth .
there is also a small neo-nazi movement within black metal , although it has been shunned by many prominent artists .
the drumming is usually fast and relies on double-bass and blast beats to maintain tempos that can sometimes approach 300 beats per minute .
`` i want to de-learn playing drums , i want to play primitive and simple , i do n't want to play like a drum solo all the time and make these complicated riffs '' .
the greek styleestablished by rotting christ , necromantia and varathronhas more traditional heavy metal and death metal traits than norwegian black metal .
death growls , common in the death metal genre , are sometimes used , but less frequently than the characteristic black metal shriek .
bands such as mayhem and gorgoroth are noted for their controversial shows , which have featured impaled animal heads , mock crucifixions , medieval weaponry and band members doused in animal blood .
a few vocalists , such as dead , maniac and kvarforth , are known for cutting themselves while singing onstage .
this was partly a reaction against death metal bands , who at that time had begun to use brightly colored album artwork .
=== roots === occult and satanic lyrical themes were present in the music of heavy rock bands of the late 1960s and early 1970s such as black sabbath and coven .
in the late 1970s , the form of rough and aggressive rock played the british band motrhead gained popularity .
many first wave black metal bands would cite motrhead as an influence .
also popular in the late 1970s , punk rock came to influence the birth of black metal .
tom g. warrior of hellhammer and celtic frost credited english hardcore punk band discharge as `` a revolution , much like venom '' , saying , `` when i heard the first two discharge records , i was blown away .
`` the use of corpse paint in the black metal imagery was mainly influenced by the american 1970s glam rock band kiss .
other artists usually considered part of this movement include kreator , sodom and destruction ( from germany ) , bulldozer and death ss ( from italy ) , whose vocalist steve sylvester was a member of the ordo templi orientis .
bands such as demoncy and profanatica emerged during this time in the united states , when death metal was more popular among extreme metal fans .
the norwegian band mayhem 's concert in leipzig with eminenz and manos in 1990 , later released as live in leipzig , was said to have had a strong influence on the east german scene and is even called the unofficial beginning of german black metal .
during 19901993 , a number of norwegian artists began performing and releasing a new kind of black metal music ; this included mayhem , darkthrone , burzum , immortal , emperor , satyricon , enslaved , thorns , carpathian forest and gorgoroth .
this was partly thanks to a new kind of guitar playing developed by snorre 'blackthorn ' ruch of stigma diabolicum/thorns and ystein 'euronymous ' aarseth of mayhem .
==== helvete and deathlike silence ==== during mayjune 1991 , euronymous of mayhem opened an independent record shop named helvete ( norwegian for hell ) in oslo .
it quickly became the focal point of norway 's emerging black metal scene and a meeting place for many of its musicians ; especially the members of mayhem , burzum , emperor and thorns .
==== dead 's suicide ==== on 8 april 1991 , mayhem vocalist per yngve ohlin ( who called himself `` dead '' ) committed suicide while alone in a house shared by the band .
before going onstage he went to great lengths to make himself look like a corpse and would cut his arms while singing .
euronymous used dead 's suicide to foster mayhem 's evil image and claimed dead had killed himself because extreme metal had become trendy and commercialized .
to coincide with the release of mayhem 's de mysteriis dom sathanas , vikernes and euronymous had also allegedly plotted to bomb nidaros cathedral , which appears on the album cover .
others , such as necrobutcher and kjetil manheim of mayhem and abbath of immortal , see the church burnings as having been futile .
euronymous 's family had asked mayhem 's drummer , hellhammer , to remove the bass tracks recorded by vikernes , but hellhammer said : `` i thought it was appropriate that the murderer and victim were on the same record '' .
and rock against communism ( rac ) , and described as being `` more akin to '60s garage punk than some of the [  ] black metal of their contemporaries '' .
this led to the rise of national socialist black metal ( nsbm ) , which hendrik mbus of absurd calls `` the logical conclusion '' of the norwegian black metal `` movement '' .
profanatica 's music is close to death metal , while demoncy were accused of ripping off gorgoroth riffs .
these bands eschew black metal 's traditional lyrical content for `` something more whitman-esque '' and have been rejected by some traditional black-metallers for their ideologies and the post-rock and shoegazing influences some of them have adopted .
it often features synthesizers or classical instrumentation , typically for melody or ethereal `` shimmering '' over the wall of sound provided by the guitars .
black 'n ' roll is a style of black metal that incorporates elements from 1970s hard rock and glam rock , as well as rock and roll music .
blackened death metal melds death metal with black metal .
examples of blackened death metal bands are belphegor , behemoth , akercocke and sacramentum .
blackgaze incorporates common black metal elements such as blast beat drumming and high-pitched screamed vocals with the melodic and heavily distorted guitar styles typically associated with shoegazing .
industrial black metal is a style of black metal that incorporates elements of industrial music .
and blacklodge from france , have been acclaimed for their incorporation of industrial elements .
other industrial black metal musicians include samael , the axis of perdition , aborym , and ... and oceans .
in addition , the kovenant , mortiis and ulver emerged from the norwegian black metal scene , but later chose to experiment with industrial music .
some common traits include a slow-paced and heavy riffing style , anthemic choruses , use of both clean and harsh vocals , a frequent reliance on folk instrumentation , and , often , the use of keyboards for atmospheric effect .
though originated from black metal , some death metal bands such as unleashed and amon amarth are included in the style .
important influences include first wave band sodom , first wave/death metal band possessed as well as old grindcore , black and death metal bands like repulsion , autopsy , sarcfago and the first two sepultura releases .
aaron weaver from wolves in the throne room said : `` black metal is an artistic movement that is critiquing modernity on a fundamental level , saying that the modern world view is missing something '' .
sam dunn noted that `` unlike any other heavy metal scene , the culture and the place is incorporated into the music and imagery '' .
they attacked the church of satan for its `` freedom and life-loving '' views ; the theistic satanism they espoused was an inversion of christianity .
however , many current unblack metal bands , such as crimson moonlight , feel that black metal has changed from an ideological movement to a purely musical genre , and thus call their music 'black metal ' .
they espouse left-wing ideologies such as marxism or anarchism/green anarchism , and tend to mix crust punk with black metal .
pure fucking mayhem ( 2009 ) tells the story of the black metal band mayhem and the tragedies surrounding them .
the episode was called `` mayhem on a cross '' and is the twenty-first episode of the fourth season .
as part of the inquiry , inspector winter tries to distinguish between black and death metal artists .
he was an active member of chicago 's ebenezer baptist church , where he studied the trombone and the violin , becoming so proficient on the violin that the musical director invited him to join the orchestra .
they re-recorded the songs at chess studios , with a backing ensemble comprising otis spann ( piano ) , lester davenport ( harmonica ) , frank kirkland ( drums ) , and jerome green ( maracas ) .
when someone on the show 's staff overheard him casually singing `` sixteen tons '' in the dressing room , he was asked to perform the song on the show .
in 1956 he and guitarist jody williams co-wrote the pop song `` love is strange '' , a hit for mickey & sylvia in 1957 .
he also wrote `` mama ( can i go out ) '' , which was a minor hit for the pioneering rockabilly singer jo ann campbell , who performed the song in the 1959 rock and roll film go johnny go .
the grateful dead released part of this concert as volume 30 of the band 's concert album series , dick 's picks .
he contributed guitar work to the song `` seventeen '' , which was included as a bonus track on the limited-edition version of the disc .
despite the fact that lawyers for both parties could not come to a renewed legal arrangement , nike allegedly continued marketing the apparel and ignored cease-and-desist orders , and a lawsuit was filed on diddley 's behalf , in manhattan federal court .
`` there was a gospel song that was sung ( at his bedside ) and ( when it was done ) he said 'wow ' with a thumbs up , '' mitchell told reuters , when asked to describe the scene at the deathbed .
' '' his funeral , a four-hour `` homegoing '' service , took place on june 7 , 2008 , at showers of blessings church in gainesville , florida , and kept in tune with the vibrant spirit of bo diddley 's life and career .
the many in attendance chanted `` hey bo diddley '' as a gospel band played the legend 's music .
he took time at both concerts to remember his friend of a half-century , performing bo 's namesake tune in his honor .
in the days following his death , tributes were paid by then-president george w. bush , the united states house of representatives , and many musicians and performers , including b .
king , ronnie hawkins , mick jagger , ronnie wood , george thorogood , eric clapton , tom petty , robert plant , elvis costello , bonnie raitt , robert randolph and the family band and eric burdon .
== accolades == bo diddley achieved numerous accolades in recognition of his significant role as one of the founding fathers of rock and roll .
describing him as `` one of the true pioneers of rock and roll , who has influenced generations '' .
bo diddley was honored by the mississippi blues commission with a mississippi blues trail historic marker placed in mccomb , his birthplace , in recognition of his enormous contribution to the development of the blues in mississippi .
one scholar found this rhythm in 13 rhythm and blues recordings made in the years 194455 , including two by johnny otis from 1948 .
sublette asserts , `` in the context of the time , and especially those maracas [ heard on the record ] , 'bo diddley ' has to be understood as a latin-tinged record .
a rejected cut recorded at the same session was titled only 'rhumba ' on the track sheets .
three years before his `` bo diddley '' , a song with similar syncopation `` hambone '' , was cut by the red saunders orchestra with the hambone kids .
in its simplest form , the bo diddley beat can be counted out as either a one-bar or a two-bar phrase .
here is the count as a one-bar phrase : one e and ah , two e and ah , three e and ah , four e and ah ( the boldface counts are the clave rhythm ) .
in his other recordings , bo diddley used various rhythms , from straight back beat to pop ballad style to doo-wop , frequently with maracas by jerome green .
he also played the violin , which is featured on his mournful instrumental `` the clock strikes twelve '' , a twelve-bar blues .
his compositions retained the hot and soulful feel of hard bop , drawing heavily from black gospel music and blues , while sometimes containing elements of third stream , free jazz , and classical music .
he once cited duke ellington and church as his main influences .
mingus espoused collective improvisation , similar to the old new orleans jazz parades , paying particular attention to how each band member interacted with the group as a whole .
because of his brilliant writing for midsize ensembles , and his catering to and emphasizing the strengths of the musicians in his groups , mingus is often considered the heir of duke ellington , for whom he expressed great admiration .
his mother allowed only church-related music in their home , but mingus developed an early love for other music , especially duke ellington .
in beneath the underdog , mingus states that he did not actually start learning bass until buddy collette accepted him into his swing band under the stipulation that he be the band 's bass player .
after the event , mingus chose to overdub his barely audible bass part back in new york ; the original version was issued later .
like ellington , mingus wrote songs with specific musicians in mind , and his band for erectus included adventurous musicians : piano player mal waldron , alto saxophonist jackie mclean and the sonny rollins-influenced tenor of j. r. monterose .
a section of the piece was free improvisation , free of structure or theme .
another album from this period , the clown ( 1957 also on atlantic records ) , the title track of which features narration by humorist jean shepherd , was the first to feature drummer dannie richmond , who remained his preferred drummer until mingus 's death in 1979 .
as mingus explained in his liner notes : `` i was born swinging and clapped my hands in church as a little boy , but i 've grown up and i like to do things other than just swing .
but blues can do more than just swing .
he initially expressed rather mixed feelings for coleman 's innovative music : `` ... if the free-form guys could play the same tune twice , then i would say they were playing something ...
most of the time they use their fingers on the saxophone and they do n't even know what 's going to come out .
in 1964 mingus put together one of his best-known groups , a sextet including dannie richmond , jaki byard , eric dolphy , trumpeter johnny coles , and tenor saxophonist clifford jordan .
in 1974 he formed a quintet with richmond , pianist don pullen , trumpeter jack walrath and saxophonist george adams .
cumbia and jazz fusion in 1976 sought to blend colombian music ( the `` cumbia '' of the title ) with more traditional jazz forms .
the three of us just wailed on the blues for about an hour and a half before he called the other cats back .
the composition is 4,235 measures long , requires two hours to perform , and is one of the longest jazz pieces ever written .
with the help of a grant from the ford foundation , the score and instrumental parts were copied , and the piece itself was premiered by a 30-piece orchestra , conducted by gunther schuller .
the complete score was published in 2008 by hal leonard .
`` new york ska jazz ensemble has done a cover of mingus 's `` haitian fight song '' , as have the british folk rock group pentangle and others .
one of the most elaborate tributes to mingus came on september 29 , 1969 , at a festival honoring him .
mingus 's elegy for duke , `` duke ellington 's sound of love '' , was recorded by kevin mahogany on double rainbow ( 1993 ) and anita wardell on why do you cry ?
the microfilms of these works were given to the music division of the new york public library where they are currently available for study .
it contains footage of mingus and interviews with artists making hal willner 's tribute album of the same name , including elvis costello , charlie watts , keith richards , and vernon reid .
computer music is the application of computing technology in music composition , to help human composers create new music or to have computers independently create music , such as with algorithmic composition programs .
== history == much of the work on computer music has drawn on the relationship between music theory and mathematics , a relationship which has been noted since the ancient greeks described the `` harmony of the spheres '' .
however , csirac played standard repertoire and was not used to extend musical thinking or composition practice which is current computer-music practice .
two further major 1950s developments were the origins of digital sound synthesis by computer , and of algorithmic composition programs beyond rote playback .
amongst other pioneers , the musical chemists lejaren hiller and leonard isaacson worked on a series of algorithmic composition experiments from 1956-9 , manifested in the 1957 premiere of the illiac suite for string quartet .
in computer music this subtle ingredient is bought at a high computational cost , both in terms of the number of items requiring detail in a score and in the amount of interpretive work the instruments must produce to realize this detail in sound .
== research == despite the ubiquity of computer music in contemporary culture , there is considerable activity in the field of computer music , as researchers continue to pursue new and interesting computer-based synthesis , composition , and performance approaches .
koenig produced algorithmic composition programs which were a generalisation of his own serial composition practice .
this sequence can in turn be a composition in itself , or simply the basis for further elaboration .
one example is band-in-a-box , which is capable of creating jazz , blues and rock instrumental solos with almost no user interaction .
another 'cybernetic ' approach to computer composition uses specialized hardware to detect external stimuli which are then mapped by the computer to realize the performance .
although these works were not actually composed with a computer in the modern sense , it uses a rudimentary form of the random combinatorial techniques sometimes used in computer-generated composition .
he wrote programs in the fortran language that generated numeric data that he transcribed into scores to be played by traditional musical instruments .
melomics , a research project from the university of mlaga , spain , developed a computer composition cluster named iamus , which composes complex , multi-instrument pieces for editing and performance .
=== computer-aided algorithmic composition === computer-aided algorithmic composition ( caac , pronounced `` sea-ack '' ) is the implementation and use of algorithmic composition techniques in software .
the label computer-aided composition lacks the specificity of using generative algorithms .
the label algorithmic composition is likewise too broad , particularly in that it does not specify the use of a computer .
== machine improvisation == machine improvisation uses computer algorithms to create improvisation on existing music materials .
in order to achieve credible improvisation in particular style , machine improvisation uses machine learning and pattern matching algorithms to analyze existing musical examples .
the resulting patterns are then used to create new variations `` in the style '' of the original music , developing a notion of stylistic reinjection .
this is different from other improvisation methods with computers that use algorithmic composition to generate new music without performing analysis of existing music examples .
=== uses of machine improvisation === machine improvisation encourages musical creativity by providing automatic modeling and transformation structures for existing music .
in offline version , machine improvisation can be used to achieve style mixing , an approach inspired by vannevar bush 's memex imaginary machine .
matlab implementation of the factor oracle machine improvisation can be found as part of computer audition toolbox .
it is based on researches on stylistic modeling carried out by gerard assayag and shlomo dubnov and on researches on improvisation with the computer by g. assayag , m. chemillier and g. bloch ( a.k.a .
a cymbal is a common percussion instrument .
cymbals are used in many ensembles ranging from the orchestra , percussion ensembles , jazz bands , heavy metal bands , and marching groups .
== etymology and names == the word cymbal is derived from the latin cymbalum , which is the latinisation of the greek word  kymbalon , `` cymbal '' , which in turn derives from  kymb , `` cup , bowl '' .
since the 19th century , some composers have called for larger roles for cymbals in musical works , and a variety of cymbal shapes , techniques , and hardware have been developed in response .
== anatomy == the anatomy of the cymbal plays a large part in the sound it creates .
a hole is drilled in the center of the cymbal , which is used to either mount the cymbal on a stand or for tying straps through ( for hand playing ) .
the bell produces a higher `` pinging '' pitch than the rest of the cymbal .
the edge or rim is the immediate circumference of the cymbal .
the size of the cymbal affects its sound , larger cymbals usually being louder and having longer sustain .
the weight describes how thick the cymbal is .
the profile of the cymbal is the vertical distance of the bow from the bottom of the bell to the cymbal edge ( higher profile cymbals are more bowl shaped ) .
the profile affects the pitch of the cymbal : higher profile cymbals have higher pitch .
=== crash cymbals === orchestral crash cymbals are traditionally used in pairs , each one having a strap set in the bell of the cymbal by which they are held .
for example , in beethoven 's ninth symphony , the percussionist is employed to first play cymbals at pianissimo , adding a touch of colour rather than loud crash .
) , secco ( dry ) , or equivalent indications on the score ; more usually , the player must judge exactly when to damp the cymbals based on the written duration of clash and the context in which it occurs .
this came from the common practice of only having one percussionist play both instruments , using one cymbal mounted to the shell of the bass drum itself .
however , in kit drumming , a cymbal crash is still most often accompanied by a simultaneous kick to the bass drum , which provides both a musical effect and a support to the crash stroke .
however , hi-hat cymbals tend to be heavy with little taper , more similar to a ride cymbal than to a clash cymbal as found in a drum kit , and perform a ride rather than a crash function .
=== suspended cymbal === another use of cymbals is the suspended cymbal .
many modern drum kits use a mount with felt or otherwise dampening fabric to act as a barrier to hold the cymbals between metal clamps : thus forming the modern day ride cymbal .
the first known instance of using a sponge-headed mallet on a cymbal is the final chord of hector berlioz ' symphonie fantastique .
composers sometimes specifically request other types of mallets like felt mallets or timpani beaters for different attack and sustain qualities .
a tremolo , or roll ( played with two mallets alternately striking on opposing sides of the cymbal ) can build in volume from almost inaudible to an overwhelming climax in a satisfyingly smooth manner ( as in humperdink 's mother goose suite ) .
the edge of a suspended cymbal may be hit with shoulder of a drum stick to obtain a sound somewhat akin to that of a pair of clash cymbals .
other methods of playing include scraping a coin or a triangle beater rapidly across the ridges on the top of the cymbal , giving a `` zing '' sound ( as some players do in the fourth movement of dvok 's symphony no .
other effects that can be used include drawing a cello or bass bow across the edge of the cymbal for a sound not unlike squealing car brakes .
orchestral cymbal playing , with an excellent short history of cymbals cymbal colour exploration , a 3d binaural audio recording of different cymbal sound colours
dead kennedys are an american punk rock band that formed in san francisco , california , in 1978 .
dead kennedys ' lyrics were usually political in nature , satirizing establishment political figures ( both liberal and conservative ) and authority in general , as well as popular culture and even the punk movement itself .
several stores refused to stock their recordings , provoking debate about censorship in rock music ; in the mid 1980s , vocalist and primary lyricist jello biafra became an active campaigner against the parents music resource center .
following the band 's dissolution , biafra continued to collaborate and record with other artists including d.o.a.
, nomeansno and his own bands lard and the guantanamo school of medicine , as well as releasing several spoken word performances .
in june , the band released their first single , `` california ber alles '' , on biafra and east bay ray 's independent label , alternative tentacles .
on march 25 , 1980 , dead kennedys were invited to perform `` california ber alles '' at the bay area music awards in an effort to give the event some `` new wave credibility '' , in the words of the organizers .
the band became the talking point of the ceremony when after about 15 seconds into the song , biafra stopped the bandin a manner reminiscent of elvis costello 's saturday night live appearanceand said , `` hold it !
we 're not a punk rock band , we 're a new wave band .
around this time klaus flouride released the similarly experimental solo ep cha cha cha with mr. flouride .
the band continued to work on songs , with biafra penning songs such as `` chickenshit conformist '' and `` anarchy for sale '' , which articulated their feelings about the `` dumbing down '' of punk rock .
`` ) , spoken word ( `` a commercial '' ) and psychedelia ( `` cesspools in eden '' ) .
ray , flouride , and peligro also went on to solo careers .
this dispute was hotly contested by all concerned who felt passionately for their cause , and the case caused minor waves within punk circles .
in addition , biafra was disdainful of the reunion , and having long expressed his disdain for nostalgia and rock reunion/oldies tours in particular , argued that the whole affair was motivated by greed .
biafra dismissed the new group as `` the world 's greediest karaoke band .
`` == music and lyrics == dead kennedys have been described as a hardcore punk band .
unlike other leftist punk bands who use more direct sloganeering , dead kennedys ' lyrics were often snide .
the disco sound often has several components , a `` four-on-the-floor '' beat , an eighth note ( quaver ) or 16th note ( semi-quaver ) hi-hat pattern with an open hi-hat on the off-beat , and a prominent , syncopated electric bass line .
in most disco tracks , string sections , horns , electric piano , and electric rhythm guitars create a lush background sound .
orchestral instruments such as the flute are often used for solo melodies , and lead guitar is less frequently used in disco than in rock .

but i think it [ disco demolition night ] hastened its demise '' ==== impact on music industry ==== the anti-disco backlash , combined with other societal and radio industry factors , changed the face of pop radio in the years following disco demolition night .
starting in the 1980s , country music began a slow rise in american main pop charts .
emblematic of country music 's rise to mainstream popularity was the commercially successful 1980 movie urban cowboy .
somewhat ironically , the star of the film was john travolta , who only three years before had starred in saturday night fever , a film that featured disco culture .
during this period of decline in disco 's popularity , several record companies folded , were reorganized , or were sold .
many groups that were popular during the disco period subsequently struggled to maintain their successeven those that tried to adapt to evolving musical tastes .
earth , wind & fire also survived the disco backlash and continued to produce hits at roughly the same pace for several more years , in addition to an even longer string of r & b chart hits that lasted into the 1990s .
==== factors contributing to disco 's decline ==== factors that have been cited as leading to the decline of disco in the united states include economic and political changes at the end of the 1970 's , as well as burnout from the hedonistic lifestyles led by participants .

and the sunshine band 's last major hit , `` give it up '' , `` running with the night '' by lionel richie , and madonna 's first album had strong disco influences .

=== euro disco === as disco 's popularity sharply declined in the united states , abandoned by major u.s. record labels and producers , european disco continued evolving within the broad mainstream pop music scene .
european acts silver convention , love and kisses , munich machine , and american acts donna summer and the village people , were acts that defined the late 1970s euro disco sound .
producers giorgio moroder , whom allmusic described as `` one of the principal architects of the disco sound '' with the donna summer hit `` i feel love '' ( 1977 ) , and jean-marc cerrone were involved with euro disco .
the german group kraftwerk also had an influence on euro disco .
by far the most successful euro disco act was abba .
( a man after midnight ) '' ( 1979 ) , and their signature smash `` dancing queen '' ( 1976 ) ranks as the eighth best-selling act of all time .
other prominent european pop and disco groups were luv ' from the netherlands and boney m. , a group of four west indian singers and dancers masterminded by west german record producer frank farian .

in italy raffaella carr is the most successful disco act .
`` other backing keyboard instruments include the piano , electric organ ( during early years ) , string synth , and electromechanical keyboards such as the fender rhodes electric piano , wurlitzer electric piano , and hohner clavinet .
synthesizers are also fairly common in disco , especially in the late 1970s .
most disco songs have a steady four-on-the-floor beat , a quaver or semi-quaver hi-hat pattern with an open hi-hat on the off-beat , and a heavy , syncopated bass line .
other latin rhythms such as the rhumba , the samba and the cha-cha-cha are also found in disco recordings , and latin polyrhythms , such as a rhumba beat layered over a merengue , are commonplace .
songs often use syncopation , which is the accenting of unexpected beats .
disco is further characterized by a 16th note division of the quarter notes as shown in the second drum pattern below , after a typical rock drum pattern .
there are , however , more minimalistic flavors of disco with reduced , transparent instrumentation , pioneered by chic .
in 1977 , giorgio moroder again became responsible for a development in disco .
it became the first well-known disco hit to have a completely synthesised backing track .
other disco producers , most famously tom moulton , grabbed ideas and techniques from dub music ( which came with the increased jamaican migration to new york city in the 1970s ) to provide alternatives to the `` four on the floor '' style that dominated .
=== production === the `` disco sound '' was much more costly to produce than many of the other popular music genres from the 1970s .
mixing engineers and record producers , under the direction of arrangers , compiled these tracks into a fluid composition of verses , bridges , and refrains , complete with orchestral builds and breaks .
mixing engineers and record producers helped to develop the `` disco sound '' by creating a distinctive-sounding disco mix .
because record sales were often dependent on floor play in leading clubs , djs were also important to the development and popularization of disco music .
== disco clubs and culture == by the late 1970s most major u.s. cities had thriving disco club scenes , but the largest scenes were in san francisco , miami , and most notably new york city .
the scene was centered on discotheques , nightclubs , and private loft parties where djs would play disco hits from discs and records through pa systems for the patrons who came to dance .
powerful , bass-heavy , hi-fi sound systems were viewed as a key part of the disco club experience .
this club played a major formative role in the growth of disco music and nightclub culture in general .
the copacabana , another new york nightclub dating to the 1940s , had a revival in the late 1970s when it embraced disco ; it would become the setting of a barry manilow hit song of the same name .
=== disco dancing === in the early years , dancers in discos danced in a `` hang loose '' or `` freestyle '' approach .
later in the disco era , popular dance styles were developed , including the `` bump '' , `` penguin '' , `` boogaloo '' , `` watergate '' and the `` robot '' .
during the disco era , many nightclubs would commonly host disco dance competitions or offer free dance lessons .
some cities had disco dance instructors or dance schools , which taught people how to do popular disco dances such as `` touch dancing , `` the hustle , and the cha cha .
the pioneer of disco dance instruction was karen lustgarten in san francisco in 1973 .
her book the complete guide to disco dancing ( warner books , 1978 ) was the first to name , break down and codify popular disco dances as dance forms and distinguish between disco freestyle , partner and line dances .
the book hit the new york times bestseller list for 13 weeks and was translated into chinese , german and french .
in chicago , the step by step disco dance tv show was launched with the sponsorship support of the coca-cola company .
the pair spent the week teaching disco dancing to dancers in the disco clubs .
the instructional show which aired on saturday mornings had a following of dancers who would stay up all night on fridays so they could be on the set the next morning , ready to return to the disco on saturday night knowing with the latest personalized dance steps .
the producers of the show , john reid and greg roselli , routinely made appearances at disco functions with robin and reggie to scout out new dancing talent and promote upcoming events such as `` disco night at white sox park '' .
for many dancers , a key source of inspiration for 1970s disco dancing was the film saturday night fever ( 1977 ) .
interest in disco dancing also helped spawn dance competition tv shows such as dance fever ( 1979 ) .
discothque-goers often wore glamorous , expensive and extravagant fashions for nights out at their local disco club .
men 's leisure suits were typically form-fitted in some parts of the body , such as the waist and bottom , but the lower part of the pants were flared in a bell bottom style , to permit freedom of movement .
during the disco era , men engaged in elaborate grooming rituals and spent time choosing fashion clothing , both activities that would have been considered `` feminine '' according to the gender stereotypes of the era .
`` quaaludes were so popular at disco clubs that the drug was nicknamed `` disco biscuits '' .
cocaine was also popular because its stimulating effect `` ... fueled all-night parties '' at disco clubs .
lsd , marijuana , and `` speed '' ( amphetamines ) were also popular in disco clubs , and the use of these drugs `` ... contributed to the hedonistic quality of the dance floor experience .
`` since disco dances were typically held in liquor licensed-nightclubs and dance clubs , alcoholic drinks were also consumed by dancers ; some users intentionally combined alcohol with the consumption of other drugs , such as quaaludes , for a stronger effect .
according to peter braunstein , the `` massive quantities of drugs ingested in discotheques produced the next cultural phenomenon of the disco era : rampant promiscuity and public sex .
while the dance floor was the central arena of seduction , actual sex usually took place in the nether regions of the disco : bathroom stalls , exit stairwells , and so on .
in other cases the disco became a kind of 'main course ' in a hedonist 's menu for a night out .
`` famous disco bars included the paradise garage and crisco disco as well as `` ... cocaine-filled celeb hangouts such as manhattan 's studio 54 , '' which was operated by steve rubell and ian schrager .
some of these influences had already begun to emerge during the mid-1970s , at the height of disco 's popularity .
during the first years of the 1980s , the disco sound began to be phased out , and faster tempos and synthesized effects , accompanied by guitar and simplified backgrounds , moved dance music toward the funk and pop genres .
this drift from the original disco sound is called post-disco .
in this music scene there are rooted subgenres , such as italo disco , techno , house , dance-pop , boogie , and early alternative dance .
during the early 1980s , dance music dropped the complicated song structure and orchestration that typified the disco sound .
=== tv themes === during the 1970s , many tv theme songs were produced ( or older themes updated ) with disco influenced music .
the british science fiction program space : 1999 ( 1975 ) also featured a soundtrack strongly influenced by disco , especially in the show 's second season .
=== dj culture === the rising popularity of disco came in tandem with developments in the role of the dj .
this in turn affected the arrangement of dance music , since songs in the disco era typically contained beginnings and endings marked by a simple beat or riff that could be easily used to transition to a new song .
djs were often avid record collectors , who would hunt through used record stores for obscure soul records and vintage funk recordings .
in the 1970s , individual djs became more prominent , and some djs , such as larry levan , the resident at paradise garage , jim burgess and tee scott became famous in the disco scene .
=== rave culture === about five years after the disco era came to a close in the late 1970s , rave culture began to emerge from the acid house scene .
rave culture incorporated disco culture 's same love of dance music played by djs over powerful sound systems , recreational drug and club drug exploration , sexual promiscuity , and hedonism .
although disco culture started out underground , it eventually thrived in the mainstream by the late 1970s , and major labels commodified and packaged the music for mass consumption .
=== hip hop and electro === the disco sound had a strong influence on early hip hop .
most of the early hip hop songs were created by isolating existing disco bass-guitar lines and dubbing over them with mc rhymes .
the sugarhill gang used chic 's `` good times '' as the foundation for their 1979 hit `` rapper 's delight '' , generally considered to be the song that first popularized rap music in the united states and around the world .
in 1982 , afrika bambaataa released the single `` planet rock '' , which incorporated electronica elements from kraftwerk 's `` trans-europe express '' and `` numbers '' as well as ymo 's `` riot in lagos '' .
since the early to mid-1990s , house music has been infused in mainstream pop and dance music worldwide .
while house displayed several characteristics similar to disco music , it was more electronic and minimalistic , and the repetitive rhythm of house was more important than the song itself .
as well , house did not use the lush string sections that were a key part of the disco sound .
=== post-punk === the post-punk movement that originated in the late 1970s both supported punk rock 's rule breaking while rejecting its move back to raw rock music .
the group 's second album metal box fully embraced the `` studio as instrument '' methodology of disco .
for shock value , james chance , a notable member of the no wave scene , penned an article in the east village eye urging his readers to move uptown and get `` trancin ' with some superadioactive disco voodoo funk '' .
his band james white and the blacks wrote a disco album off white .
their performances resembled those of disco performers ( horn section , dancers and so on ) .
in 1981 ze records led the transition from no wave into the more subtle mutant disco ( post-disco/punk ) genre .
mutant disco acts such as kid creole and the coconuts , was not was , esg and liquid liquid influenced several british post-punk acts such as new order , orange juice and a certain ratio .

accompanied by guitarist scotty moore and bassist bill black , presley was an early popularizer of rockabilly , an uptempo , backbeat-driven fusion of country music and rhythm and blues .
he was regarded as the leading figure of rock and roll after a series of successful network television appearances and chart-topping records .
he resumed his recording career two years later , producing some of his most commercially successful work before devoting much of the 1960s to making hollywood films and their accompanying soundtrack albums , most of which were critically derided .
he was encouraged to enter a singing contest after impressing his schoolteacher with a rendition of red foley 's country song `` old shep '' during morning prayers .
the contest , held at the mississippi-alabama fair and dairy show on october 3 , 1945 , was his first public performance : dressed as a cowboy , the ten-year-old presley stood on a chair to reach the microphone and sang `` old shep '' .
when his music teacher told him he had no aptitude for singing , he brought in his guitar the next day and sang a recent hit , `` keep them cold icy fingers off me '' , in an effort to prove otherwise .
a classmate later recalled that the teacher `` agreed that elvis was right when he said that she did n't appreciate his kind of singing .
in his free time , he would head down to beale street , the heart of memphis 's thriving blues scene , and gaze longingly at the wild , flashy clothes in the windows of lansky brothers .
the southern gospel singer jake hess , one of his favorite performers , was a significant influence on his ballad-singing style .
he was a regular audience member at the monthly all-night singings downtown , where many of the white gospel groups that performed reflected the influence of african-american spiritual music .
he adored the music of black gospel singer sister rosetta tharpe .
like some of his peers , he may have attended blues venuesof necessity , in the segregated south , on only the nights designated for exclusively white audiences .
he certainly listened to the regional radio stations , such as wdia-am , that played `` race records '' : spirituals , blues , and the modern , backbeat-heavy sound of rhythm and blues .
`` songfellow jim hamill later claimed that he was turned down because he did not demonstrate an ear for harmony at the time .
as they were about to give up and go home , presley took his guitar and launched into a 1946 blues number , arthur crudup 's `` that 's all right '' .
according to moore , `` his movement was a natural thing , but he was also very conscious of what got a reaction .
by august , sun had released ten sides credited to `` elvis presley , scotty and bill '' ; on the latest recordings , the trio were joined by a drummer .
haley observed that presley had a natural feel for rhythm , and advised him to sing fewer ballads .
parker arranged with the owners of hill and range publishing , jean and julian aberbach , to create two entities , elvis presley music and gladys music , to handle all the new material recorded by presley .
there were two country songs and a bouncy pop tune .
he not only injected the tunes with his own vocal character but also made guitar , not piano , the lead instrument in all three cases .
twelve weeks after its original release , `` heartbreak hotel '' became presley 's first number-one pop hit .
he had attended several shows by freddie bell and the bellboys in vegas and was struck by their cover of `` hound dog '' , a hit in 1953 for blues singer big mama thornton by songwriters jerry leiber and mike stoller .
`` the second milton berle show appearance came on june 5 at nbc 's hollywood studio , amid another hectic tour .
newspaper critics were outraged : jack gould of the new york times wrote , `` mr. presley has no discernible singing ability .
... his phrasing , if it can be called that , consists of the stereotyped variations that go with a beginner 's aria in a bathtub .
... his one specialty is an accented movement of the body ... primarily identified with the repertoire of the blond bombshells of the burlesque runway .
`` ben gross of the new york daily news opined that popular music `` has reached its lowest depths in the 'grunt and groin ' antics of one elvis presley .
allen , no fan of rock and roll , introduced a `` new elvis '' in a white bow tie and black tails .
i mean , how would rock 'n ' roll music make anyone rebel against their parents ?
the jordanaires sang harmony , as they had on the steve allen show ; they would work with presley through the 1960s .
recording sessions for presley 's second album took place in hollywood during the first week of september .
igniting the `` biggest pop craze since glenn miller and frank sinatra ... presley brought rock'n'roll into the mainstream of popular culture '' , writes historian marty jezer .
the album includes `` old shep '' , which he sang at the talent show in 1945 , and which now marked the first time he played piano on an rca session .
`` loving you , the accompanying soundtrack , was presley 's third straight number one album .
the title track was written by leiber and stoller , who were then retained to write four of the six songs recorded at the sessions for jailhouse rock , presley 's next film .
`` according to stoller , the duo was `` surprised at the kind of knowledge that he had about black music .
we figured that he had these remarkable pipes and all that , but we did n't realize that he knew so much about the blues .
he certainly knew a lot more than we did about country music and gospel music .
a detroit newspaper suggested that `` the trouble with going to see elvis presley is that you 're liable to get killed .
in a magazine article , he decried rock and roll as `` brutal , ugly , degenerate , vicious .
toward the end of the session , they wrote a song on the spot at presley 's request : `` santa claus is back in town '' , an innuendo-laden blues .
a couple of weeks into the new year , `` do n't '' , another leiber and stoller tune , became presley 's tenth number one seller .
recording sessions for the king creole soundtrack were held in hollywood mid-january .
another nashville session two weeks later yielded a pair of his best-selling singles , the ballads `` it 's now or never '' and `` are you lonesome tonight ?
the album features several songs described by greil marcus as full of chicago blues `` menace , driven by presley 's own super-miked acoustic guitar , brilliant playing by scotty moore , and demonic sax work from boots randolph .
elvis 's singing was n't sexy , it was pornographic .
presley returned to television on may 12 as a guest on the frank sinatra timex specialironic for both stars , given sinatra 's not-so-distant excoriation of rock and roll .
parker secured an unheard-of $ 125,000 fee for eight minutes of singing .
blues , the soundtrack to presley 's first film since his return , was a number one album in october .
it reached number 13 on the u.s. pop chart and number 3 in the uk , remarkable figures for a gospel album .
as described by john robertson , it exemplifies the nashville sound , the restrained , cosmopolitan style that would define country music in the 1960s .
==== lost in hollywood ==== parker had by now pushed presley into a heavy film making schedule , focused on formulaic , modestly budgeted musical comedies .
hal wallis , who produced nine of them , declared , `` a presley picture is the only sure thing in hollywood .
`` of presley 's films in the 1960s , 15 were accompanied by soundtrack albums and another 5 by soundtrack eps .
according to jerry leiber , the soundtrack formula was already evident before presley left for the army : `` three ballads , one medium-tempo [ number ] , one up-tempo , and one break blues boogie '' .
as the decade wore on , the quality of the soundtrack songs grew `` progressively worse '' .
but by and large , according to biographer jerry hopkins , the numbers seemed to be `` written on order by men who never really understood elvis or rock and roll .
( `` viva las vegas '' , the title track to the 1964 film , was a minor hit as a b-side , and became truly popular only later .
during a five-year span1964 through 1968presley had only one top-ten hit : `` crying in the chapel '' ( 1965 ) , a gospel number recorded back in 1960 .
as marsh described , presley was `` arguably the greatest white gospel singer of his time [ and ] really the last rock & roll artist to make gospel as vital a component of his musical personality as his secular songs .
it was not until october 1967 , when the clambake soundtrack lp registered record low sales for a new presley album , that rca executives recognized a problem .
`` elvis was viewed as a joke by serious music lovers and a has-been to all but his most loyal fans .
his forthcoming soundtrack album , speedway , would die at number 82 on the billboard chart .
the live segments saw presley clad in tight black leather , singing and playing guitar in an uninhibited style reminiscent of his early rock-and-roll days .
he sang with the kind of power people no longer expect of rock 'n ' roll singers .
the soundtrack album broke into the top ten .
according to friend jerry schilling , the special reminded presley of what `` he had not been able to do for years , being able to choose the people ; being able to choose what songs and not being told what had to be on the soundtrack .
as described by dave marsh , it is `` a masterpiece in which presley immediately catches up with pop music trends that had seemed to pass him by during the movie years .
he sings country songs , soul songs and rockers with real conviction , a stunning achievement .
presley assembled new , top-notch accompaniment , led by guitarist james burton and including two gospel groups , the imperials and the sweet inspirations .
for his part , hotel owner kirk kerkorian arranged to send his own plane to new york to fly in rock journalists for the debut performance .
`` no , '' presley said , `` that 's the real king of rock and roll .
`` suspicious minds '' reached the top of the chartspresley 's first u.s. pop number one in over seven years , and his last .
in april , the single `` the wonder of you '' was issueda number one hit in the uk , it topped the u.s. adult contemporary chart , as well .
as music historian john robertson notes , `` the authority of presley 's singing helped disguise the fact that the album stepped decisively away from the american-roots inspiration of the memphis sessions towards a more middle-of-the-road sound .
with country put on the back burner , and soul and r & b left in memphis , what was left was very classy , very clean white popperfect for the las vegas crowd , but a definite retrograde step for elvis .
not long after , the city of memphis named the stretch of highway 51 south on which graceland is located `` elvis presley boulevard '' .
the same year , presley became the first rock and roll singer to be awarded the lifetime achievement award ( then known as the bing crosby award ) by the national academy of recording arts and sciences , the grammy award organization .
`` in the midst of ten painfully genteel christmas songs , every one sung with appalling sincerity and humility , one could find elvis tom-catting his way through six blazing minutes of 'merry christmas baby , ' a raunchy old charles brown blues .
his gospel album he touched me , released that month , would earn him his second grammy award , for best inspirational performance .
after the tour , the single `` burning love '' was releasedpresley 's last top ten hit on the u.s. pop chart .
`` the most exciting single elvis has made since 'all shook up ' '' , wrote rock critic robert christgau .
`` who else could make 'it 's coming closer , the flames are now licking my body ' sound like an assignation with james brown 's backup band ?
the first show served as a practice run and backup should technical problems affect the live broadcast two days later .
it proved to be presley 's last u.s. number one pop album during his lifetime .
( all three of his competitive grammy winsout of 14 total nominationswere for gospel recordings .
) presley returned to the studio in hollywood in march 1975 , but parker 's attempts to arrange another session toward the end of the year were unsuccessful .
the story was similar with his singlesthere were no major pop hits , but presley was a significant force in not just the country market , but on adult contemporary radio as well .
`` my boy '' was a number one adult contemporary hit in 1975 , and `` moody blue '' topped the country chart and reached the second spot on the adult contemporary chart in 1976 .
perhaps his most critically acclaimed recording of the era came that year , with what greil marcus described as his `` apocalyptic attack '' on the soul classic `` hurt '' .
in rapid city , south dakota , `` he was so nervous on stage that he could hardly talk '' , according to presley historian samuel roy , and unable to `` perform any significant movement .
the book elvis : what happened ?
, cowritten by the three bodyguards fired the previous year , was published on august 1 .
he was devastated by the book and tried unsuccessfully to halt its release by offering money to the publishers .
within a few days , `` way down '' topped the country and uk pop charts .
the latter was an outright hit in the uk , reaching number three on the pop chart .
in november 2010 , viva elvis : the album was released , setting his voice to newly recorded instrumental tracks .
== artistry == === influences === presley 's earliest musical influence came from gospel .
`` he went about as far as you could go in gospel music , '' said jake hess .
`` the women would jump up , just like they do for the pop shows .
when jerry leiber and mike stoller met him two years later , they were astonished at his encyclopedic understanding of the blues .
`` however , `` rockabilly crystallized into a recognizable style in 1954 with elvis presley 's first release , on the sun label '' , writes craig morrison .
in `` that 's all right '' , the presley trio 's first record , scotty moore 's guitar solo , `` a combination of merle travisstyle country finger-picking , double-stop slides from acoustic boogie , and blues-based bent-note , single-string work , is a microcosm of this fusion .
`` at rca , presley 's rock and roll sound grew distinct from rockabilly with group chorus vocals , more heavily amplified electric guitars and a tougher , more intense manner .
`` on his second lp to the blues of `` santa claus is back in town '' .
in 1957 , his first gospel record was released , the four-song ep peace in the valley .
certified as a million seller , it became the top-selling gospel ep in recording history .
presley would record gospel periodically for the rest of his life .
after his return from military service in 1960 , presley continued to perform rock and roll , but the characteristic style was substantially toned down .
rca publicity materials referred to its `` mild rock beat '' ; discographer ernst jorgensen calls it `` upbeat pop '' .
was essentially abandoned for six years until such 196667 recordings as `` down in the alley '' and `` hi-heel sneakers '' , though marsh holds that while he may have recorded few blues songs in the early to middle sixties , `` blues informs almost everything here .
`` the singer 's output during most of the 1960s emphasized pop music , often in the form of ballads such as `` are you lonesome tonight ?
`` while presley performed several of his classic ballads for the '68 comeback special , the sound of the show was dominated by aggressive rock and roll .
he would record few new straight-ahead rock and roll songs thereafter ; as he explained , they were `` hard to find '' .
a significant exception was `` burning love '' , his last major hit on the pop charts .
like his work of the 1950s , presley 's subsequent recordings reworked pop and country songs , but in markedly different permutations .
his stylistic range now began to embrace a more contemporary rock sound as well as soul and funk .
much of elvis in memphis , as well as `` suspicious minds '' , cut at the same sessions , reflected his new rock and soul fusion .
=== vocal style and range === the general development of presley 's voice is described by critic dave marsh as `` high and thrilled in the early days , lower and perplexed in the final months .
`` marsh describes the singing on `` ca n't help falling in love '' to be of `` gentle insistence and delicacy of phrasing , '' with the line `` 'shall i stay ' '' pronounced as if the words are fragile as crystal .
hess himself thought that while others may have a voice as great or greater than presley 's , `` he had that certain something that everyone searches for all during their lifetime .
`` describing his piano technique as `` staccato style , '' jorgensen finds that on `` without love '' from the 1969 sessions , `` his gospel-flavored treatment took it to a level of spirituality rarely matched in his career .
`` the performance on `` in the ghetto '' is , according to jorgensen , `` devoid of any of his characteristic vocal tricks or mannerisms , '' instead relying on `` the astonishing clarity and sensitivity of his voice .
`` guralnick describes the tenderness in the singing of the same song of `` such unassuming , almost translucent eloquence , it is so quietly confident in its simplicity '' that one is reminded of the sun period , `` offering equal parts yearning and social compassion .
`` in pleasants ' view , his voice was `` variable and unpredictable '' at the bottom , `` often brilliant '' at the top , with the capacity for `` full-voiced high gs and as that an opera baritone might envy '' .
`` presley was always `` able to duplicate the open , hoarse , ecstatic , screaming , shouting , wailing , reckless sound of the black rhythm-and-blues and gospel singers , '' writes pleasants , and also demonstrated a remarkable ability to assimilate many other vocal styles .
`` the memphis world , an african american newspaper , reported that presley , `` the rock 'n ' roll phenomenon '' , `` cracked memphis 's segregation laws '' by attending the local amusement park on what was designated as its `` colored night '' .
regardless of whether parents were aware of the negro sexual origins of the phrase 'rock 'n ' roll ' , presley impressed them as the visual and aural embodiment of sex .
but rock 'n ' roll was here a long time before i came along .
into the 21st century , the notion that presley had `` stolen '' black music still found adherents .
notable among african american entertainers expressly rejecting this view was jackie wilson , who argued , `` a lot of people have accused elvis of stealing the black man 's music , when in fact , almost every black solo entertainer copied his stage mannerisms from elvis .
addressing his '68 comeback special audience , he said , `` rock 'n ' roll music is basically gospel or rhythm and blues , or it sprang from that .
it used to be called rhythm and blues .
`` reinforcing presley 's image as a sex symbol were the reports of his dalliances with various hollywood stars and starlets , from natalie wood in the 1950s to connie stevens and ann-margret in the 1960s to candice bergen and cybill shepherd in the 1970s .
presley never grew comfortable with the hollywood scene , and most of these relationships were insubstantial .
leiber thought there was a mistakethe sheet of paper was blank except for parker 's signature and a line on which to enter his .
in leiber 's telling , jean aberbach warned them to never again `` try to interfere with the business or artistic workings of the process known as elvis presley .
as the catalyst for the cultural revolution that was rock and roll , he was central not only to defining it as a musical genre but in making it a touchstone of youth culture and rebellious attitude .
they would n't let black music through .
he opened the door for black music .
presley 's name , image , and voice are instantly recognizable around the globe .
`` elvis presley is the greatest cultural force in the twentieth century '' , said composer and conductor leonard bernstein .
the cultural range of his music has expanded to the point where it includes not only the hits of the day , but also patriotic recitals , pure country gospel , and really dirty blues .
his career began and he was most successful during an era when singles were the primary commercial medium for pop music .
for most of the 1960s , his recording career focused on soundtrack albums .
billboard pop chart ; the billboard country chart , the genre chart with which he was most identified ( there was no country album chart before 1964 ) ; and the official british pop chart .
before late 1958 , rather than unified pop and country singles charts , billboard had as many as four charts for each , separately ranking records according to sales , jukebox play , jockey spins ( i.e.
, airplay ) , and , in the case of pop , a general `` top 100 '' .
presley discographer ernst jorgensen refers only to the top 100 chart for pop hits .
it can also be used to refer to a gathering with the primary purpose of singing filk songs .
as a verb : ( intransitive ) to participate in filk singing , not necessarily as a planned or organized event , as in , `` we were filking last night until three in the morning .
=== style and content === filk has been defined as folk music , usually with a science fiction or fantasy theme , but this definition is not exact .
one of the few rock-style groups in filk has been ookla the mok , whose studio recordings use techniques common in modern rock .
a significant number of filk songs are parodies , whether in the original sense of simply re-using a tune or in the modern sense of specifically humorous re-use .
== history == for the first few decades of the occasional science fiction convention , there had been late-night singing sessions in hotel rooms .
at the 1974 world science fiction convention author bob asprin announced publicly the creation of a group of volunteers he dubbed the dorsai irregulars , and a singing session ensued later that night .
a large filk circle might play host to an array of folk and celtic instruments such as fiddles , mandolins , dulcimers , banjos , flutes , recorders , bodhrns , bongos and darbukas .
songs can be chosen to fit the current mood or theme , or they may be chosen to deliberately change the mood .
there are variations of these styles , some of the variants involving a person acting as a moderator .
although singing along and playing along with instruments ( including improvisation ) is usually encouraged , filk circles are not like jam sessions .
jam sessions are usually focused on extended instrumental improvisation with everyone performing simultaneously , whereas filk circles tend to be more focused on a single performer or group singing an individual song during their turn .

folk music includes both traditional music and the genre that evolved from it during the 20th century folk revival .
starting in the mid-20th century , a new form of popular folk music evolved from traditional folk music .
while contemporary folk music is a genre generally distinct from traditional folk music , in english it shares the same name , and it often shares the same performers and venues as traditional folk music .
== traditional folk music == === definitions === a consistent definition of traditional folk music is elusive .
for example , the grammy award previously used the terms `` traditional music '' and `` traditional folk '' for folk music that is not contemporary folk music .
==== characteristics ==== from a historical perspective , traditional folk music had these characteristics : it was transmitted through an oral tradition .
hundreds of folk songs from the 19th century have known authors but have continued in oral tradition to the point where they are considered traditional for purposes of music publishing .
fusion of cultures : because cultures interact and change over time , traditional songs evolving over time may incorporate and reflect influences from disparate cultures .
the relevant factors may include instrumentation , tunings , voicings , phrasing , subject matter , and even production methods .
manual labor often included singing by the workers , which served several practical purposes .
in leisure time , singing and playing musical instruments were common forms of entertainment and history-tellingeven more common than today , when electrically enabled technologies and widespread literacy make other forms of entertainment and information-sharing competitive .
in the proliferation of popular music genres , some traditional folk music became also referred to `` world music '' or `` roots music '' .
the english term `` folklore '' , to describe traditional folk music and dance , entered the vocabulary of many continental european nations , each of which had its folk-song collectors and revivalists .
this completed a process to where `` folk music '' no longer meant only traditional folk music .
=== subject matter === traditional folk music often includes sung words , although folk instrumental music occurs commonly in dance music traditions .
narrative verse looms large in the traditional folk music of many cultures .
this encompasses such forms as traditional epic poetry , much of which was meant originally for oral performance , sometimes accompanied by instruments .
many epic poems of various cultures were pieced together from shorter pieces of traditional narrative verse , which explains their episodic structure , repetitive elements , and their frequent in medias res plot developments .
other forms of traditional narrative verse relate the outcomes of battles or describe tragedies or natural disasters .
the narratives of traditional songs often also remember folk heroes such as john henry or robin hood .
some traditional song narratives recall supernatural events or mysterious deaths .
hymns and other forms of religious music are often of traditional and unknown origin .
traditional songs such as green grow the rushes , o present religious lore in a mnemonic form , as do western christmas carols and similar traditional songs .
nursery rhymes and nonsense verse used to amuse or quiet children also are frequent subjects of traditional songs .
=== folk song transformations and variations === music transmitted by word of mouth through a community , in time , develops many variants , because this kind of transmission can not produce word-for-word and note-for-note accuracy .
indeed , many traditional singers are quite creative and deliberately modify the material they learn .
field researchers in traditional song ( see below ) have encountered countless versions of this ballad throughout the english-speaking world , and these versions often differ greatly from each other .
the influential folklorist cecil sharp felt that these competing variants of a traditional song would undergo a process of improvement akin to biological natural selection : only those new variants that were the most appealing to ordinary singers would be picked up by others and transmitted onward in time .
thus , over time we would expect each traditional song to become aesthetically ever more appealing  it would be collectively composed to perfection , as it were , by the community .
=== regional forms === while the loss of traditional folk music in the face of the rise of popular music is a worldwide phenomenon , it is not one occurring at a uniform rate throughout the world .
one such effort was the collection by francis james child in the late 19th century of the texts of over three hundred ballads in the english and scots traditions ( called the child ballads ) , some of which predated the 16th century .
sharp campaigned with some success to have english traditional songs ( in his own heavily edited and expurgated versions ) to be taught to school children in hopes of reviving and prolonging the popularity of those songs .
throughout the 1960s and early to mid-1970s , american scholar bertrand harris bronson published an exhaustive four-volume collection of the then-known variations of both the texts and tunes associated with what came to be known as the child canon .
one of the most extensive was perhaps the work done in riga by krisjanis barons , who between the years 1894 and 1915 published six volumes that included the texts of 217,996 latvian folk songs , the latvju dainas .
in norway the work of collectors such as ludvig mathias lindeman was extensively used by edvard grieg in his lyric pieces for piano and in other works , which became immensely popular .
around this time , composers of classical music developed a strong interest in collecting traditional songs , and a number of outstanding composers carried out their own field work on traditional music .
these composers , like many of their predecessors , both made arrangements of folk songs and incorporated traditional material into original classical compositions .
in north america , during the 1930s and 1940s , the library of congress worked through the offices of traditional music collectors robert winslow gordon , alan lomax and others to capture as much north american field material as possible .
lomax was the first prominent scholar to study distinctly american folk music such as that of cowboys and southern blacks .
cecil sharp also worked in america , recording the traditional songs of the appalachian mountains in 19161918 in collaboration with maud karpeles and olive dame campbell and is considered the first major scholar covering american folk music .
one strong theme amongst folk scholars in the early decades of the 20th century was regionalism , the analysis of the diversity of folk music ( and related cultures ) based on regions of the us rather than based on a given song 's historical roots .
he also collected songs in his travels and , in 1927 , published them in a book american songbag .
`` in his collections of folk songs , sandburg added a class dynamic to popular understandings of american folk music .
prior to the 1930s , the study of folk music was primarily the province of scholars and collectors .
the folk music movement , festivals , and the wartime effort were seen as forces for social goods such as democracy , cultural pluralism , and the removal of culture and race-based barriers .
`` by the end of the 1930s these and others had turned american folk music into a social movement .
for example , jean ritchie ( born in 1922 ) was the youngest child of a large family from viper , kentucky that had preserved many of the old appalachian traditional songs .
han traditional weddings and funerals usually include a form of oboe called a suona and apercussive ensembles called a chuigushou .
in southern fujian and taiwan , nanyin or nanguan is a genre of traditional ballads .
they are sung by a woman accompanied by a xiao and a pipa , as well as other traditional instruments .
guangdong music or cantonese music is instrumental music from guangzhou and surrounding areas .
many pieces have influences from jazz and western music , using syncopation and triple time .
the folk songs and poems were used in social gatherings to work together .
the traditional drama , music and songs are typically sri lankan .
the classical sinhalese orchestra consists of five categories of instruments , but among the percussion instruments , the drum is essential for dance .
this drum beat may seem simple on the first hearing but it takes a long time to master the intricate rhythms and variations , which the drummer sometimes can bring to a crescendo of intensity .
the rhyming songs , poems and tales written in the form of bush ballads often relate to the itinerant and rebellious spirit of australia in the bush , and the authors and performers are often referred to as bush bards .
the 19th century was the golden age of bush ballads .
the traditional forms include many aspects of performance and musical instrumentation unique to particular regions or indigenous australian groups .
==== europe ==== ===== celtic traditional music ===== celtic music is a term used by artists , record companies , music stores and music magazines to describe a broad grouping of musical genres that evolved out of the folk musical traditions of the celtic peoples .
those folk songs revived in the late 18th century period of german romanticism , first promoted by johann gottfried herder and other advocates of the enlightenment , later compiled by achim von arnim and clemens brentano ( des knaben wunderhorn ) as well as by ludwig uhland .
traditional volksmusik is not to be confused with commercial volkstmliche musik variations , strongly related to german schlager music .
the hungarian group muzsiks played numerous american tours and participated in the hollywood movie the english patient while the singer mrta sebestyn worked with the band deep forest .
the hungarian tnchz movement , started in the 1970s , involves strong cooperation between musicology experts and enthusiastic amateurs .
however , traditional hungarian folk music and folk culture barely survived in some rural areas of hungary , and it has also begun to disappear among the ethnic hungarians in transylvania .
the movement spread to ethnic hungarian communities elsewhere in the world .
most swedish instrumental folk music is dance music ; the signature music and dance form within swedish folk music is the polska .
the nueva cancin movement of the 1970s revived the genre across latin america and bought it to places where it was unknown or forgotten .
nueva cancin ( spanish for 'new song ' ) is a movement and genre within latin american and iberian music of folk music , folk-inspired music and socially committed music .
this includes evolution of this new genre from traditional folk music , essentially contemporary folk music except that that english genre term is not commonly applied to it .
nueva cancin renewed traditional latin american folk music , and was soon associated with revolutionary movements , the latin american new left , liberation theology , hippie and human rights movements due to political lyrics .
is often performed with a 6-string nylon acoustic guitar , but the most traditional instrument is the viola caipira .
==== north america ==== ===== canada ===== canada 's traditional folk music is particularly diverse .
agrarian settlement in eastern and southern ontario and western quebec in the early 19th century established a favorable milieu for the survival of many anglo-canadian folksongs and broadside ballads from great britain and the us .
part of this mosaic is supplied by the folk songs of canada brought by european and anglo-saxon settlers to the new land .
ethnographer and folklorist marius barbeau estimated that well over ten thousand french folk songs and their variants had been collected in canada .
while in urban music clubs of the dance hall/vaudeville variety became popular , followed by jazz , rural canada remained mostly a land of traditional music .
yet when american radio networks began broadcasting into canada in the 1920s and 1930s , the audience for canadian traditional music progressively declined in favour of american nashville-style country music and urban styles like jazz .
===== united states ===== american traditional music is also called roots music .
some of these genres are considered to be traditional folk music .
