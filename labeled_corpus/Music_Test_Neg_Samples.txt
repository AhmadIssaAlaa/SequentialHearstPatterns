its music was created with the intention of listening and contemplation rather than for dancing , and is often distinguished by the use of electronic effects and easy listening textures far removed from the propulsive rhythms of early rock .
the term may sometimes be used interchangeably with `` progressive rock '' , though the latter is instead characterized in particular by its employment of classically trained instrumental technique and symphonic textures .
== definitions == critic john rockwell says that art rock is one of rock 's most wide-ranging and eclectic genres with its overt sense of creative detachment , classical music pretensions , and experimental , avant-garde proclivities .
in the rock music of the 1970s , the `` art '' descriptor was generally understood to mean `` aggressively avant-garde '' or `` pretentiously progressive '' .
`` art rock '' is often used synonymously with progressive rock .
historically , the term has been used to describe at least two related , but distinct , types of rock music .
the first is progressive rock , while the second usage refers to groups who rejected psychedelia and the hippie counterculture in favor of a modernist , avant-garde approach defined by the velvet underground .
art rock emphasizes romantic and autonomous traditions , in distinction to the aesthetic of the everyday and the disposable embodied by art pop .
differences have been identified between art rock and progressive rock , with art rock emphasizing avant-garde or experimental influences and `` novel sonic structure '' , while progressive rock has been characterized as putting a greater emphasis on classically trained instrumental technique , literary content , and symphonic features .
compared to progressive rock , art rock is `` more challenging , noisy and unconventional '' and `` less classically influenced '' , with more of an emphasis on avant-garde music .
similarities are that they both describe a mostly british attempt to elevate rock music to new levels of artistic credibility , and became the instrumental analog to concept albums and rock operas , which were typically more vocal oriented .
art rock can also to refer to either classically driven rock , or a progressive rock-folk fusion .
`` == history == === 1960s === ==== background ==== the boundaries between art and pop music became increasingly blurred throughout the second half of the 20th century .
the first usage of the term `` art rock '' , according to merriam-webster online dictionary , was in 1968 .
as pop music 's dominant format transitioned from singles to albums , many rock bands created works that aspired to make grand artistic statements , where art rock would flourish .
as it progressed in the late 1960s  in tandem with the development of progressive rock  art rock acquired notoriety alongside experimental rock .
==== proponents ==== the earliest figure of art rock has been assumed to be record producer and songwriter phil spector , who became known as an auteur for his wall of sound productions that aspired to a `` classical grandiosity '' .
biographer peter ames carlin wrote that wilson was the forerunner of `` a new kind of art-rock that would combine the transcendent possibilities of art with the mainstream accessibility of pop music '' .
critic stephen holden says that mid-1960s recordings by the beatles , spector and wilson are often identified as marking the start of art pop , which preceded the `` bombastic , classically inflected '' art rock that started in the late 1960s .
many of the top british groups during the 1960s  including members of the beatles , the rolling stones , the kinks , the who , the move , the yardbirds and pink floyd  came to music via art school .
by the mid-1960s , several of these acts espoused an approach based on art and originality , where previously they had been absorbed solely in authentic interpretation of us-derived musical styles , such as rock 'n ' roll and r & b .
`` author matthew bannister traces `` the more self-conscious , camp aesthetic of art rock '' to pop artist andy warhol and the velvet underground , who emulated warhol 's art/pop synthesis .
accordingly : `` warhol took spector 's combination of the disembodiment , 'distance ' and refinement of high culture with the 'immediacy ' of mass cultural forms like rock and roll several stages further ...
but warhols aesthetic was more thoroughly worked out than spector 's , which represented a transitional phase between old-fashioned auteurism and the thoroughly postmodern , detached tenets of pop art .
... warhol 's approach reverberates throughout art rock , most obviously in his stance of distance and disengagement .
`` ==== influential albums ==== ===== 196566 ===== the december 1965 release of the beatles ' rubber soul signified a watershed for the pop album , transforming it in scope from a collection of singles with lesser-quality tracks to a distinct art form , filled with high-quality original compositions .
the period when rock music became most closely aligned with art began in 1966 , the year in which the beach boys ' pet sounds and the mothers of invention 's freak out !
academic michael johnson associates `` the first documented moments of ascension in rock music '' to pet sounds .
`` pet sounds is also noted as the first rock concept album .
in 1971 , cue magazine described the beach boys as having been `` among the vanguard '' with regard to art rock , among many other aspects relating to the counterculture , over the period up to late 1967 .
jacqueline edmondson 's 2013 encyclopedia music in american life states that , although it was preceded by earlier examples , frank zappa and the mothers of invention 's debut album freak out !
( june 1966 ) came to be seen as `` the first successful incorporation of art music in a pop context '' .
the beatles ' revolver ( august 1966 ) furthered the album-as-art perspective and continued pop music 's evolution .
according to rolling stone , `` revolver signaled that in popular music , anything  any theme , any musical idea  could now be realized .
`` as with rubber soul , the album inspired many of the progressive rock artists of the 1970s , and each of its songs has been recognised as anticipating a new subgenre or style .
bannister writes of the velvet underground : `` no other band exerted the same grip on the minds of 1970s/1980s art/alternative rock artists , writers and audiences .
`` the beatles ' paul mccartney deemed pet sounds `` the record of the time '' , and in june 1967 , the band responded with their own album : sgt .
allmusic states that the first wave of art rock musicians were inspired by sgt .
pepper 's and believed that for rock music to grow artistically , they should incorporate elements of european and classical music to the genre .
many british groups flowered in the album 's wake ; those who are listed in music in american life include the moody blues , the strawbs , genesis , and `` most notably '' , pink floyd .
=== 1970s90s === art rock 's greatest level of popularity was in the early 1970s through british artists .
enthusiasm for art rock explorations waned in the mid 1970s .
from then to the 1990s , art rock was infused within various popular music genres .
`` in the 1980s , a new generation of english art rockers took the place of 1970s bands like yes , genesis , jethro tull and emerson , lake & palmer .
when the band 's colin moulding was asked whether he felt the band was closer to art rock or new wave , he responded ; `` we 've always had the art-rock appeal rather than street credibility .
charles edward anderson berry ( october 18 , 1926  march 18 , 2017 ) was an american guitarist , singer and songwriter and one of the pioneers of rock and roll music .
writing lyrics that focused on teen life and consumerism , and developing a music style that included guitar solos and showmanship , berry was a major influence on subsequent rock music .
by early 1953 , influenced by the guitar riffs and showmanship techniques of the blues musician t-bone walker , berry began performing with the johnnie johnson trio .
with chess , he recorded `` maybellene '' berry 's adaptation of the country song `` ida red '' which sold over a million copies , reaching number one on billboard magazine 's rhythm and blues chart .
but these did not achieve the same success , or lasting impact , of his 1950s songs , and by the 1970s he was more in demand as a nostalgic performer , playing his past hits with local backup bands of variable quality .
berry was among the first musicians to be inducted into the rock and roll hall of fame on its opening in 1986 ; he was cited for having `` laid the groundwork for not only a rock and roll sound but a rock and roll stance .
he was convicted and sent to the intermediate reformatory for young men at algoa , near jefferson city , missouri , where he formed a singing quartet and did some boxing .
the singing group became competent enough that the authorities allowed it to perform outside the detention facility .
he had been playing blues since his teens , and he borrowed both guitar riffs and showmanship techniques from the blues musician t-bone walker .
berry thought his blues music would be of more interest to chess , but to his surprise it was a traditional country fiddle tune , `` ida red '' , as recorded by bob wills , that got chess 's attention .
chess had seen the rhythm and blues market shrink and was looking to move beyond it , and he thought berry might be the artist for that purpose .
`` maybellene '' sold over a million copies , reaching number one on billboard magazine 's rhythm and blues chart and number five on its best sellers in stores chart for september 10 , 1955 .
berry said , `` it came out at the right time when afro-american music was spilling over into the mainstream pop .
perkins said that `` i knew when i first heard chuck that he 'd been affected by country music .
`` as they toured , perkins discovered that berry not only liked country music but also knew about as many songs as he did .
he was a guest on abc 's guy mitchell show , singing his hit song `` rock 'n ' roll music '' .
the track became his only number-one single .
allmusic said that in this period his `` live performances became increasingly erratic , ... working with terrible backup bands and turning in sloppy , out-of-tune performances '' which `` tarnished his reputation with younger fans and oldtimers '' alike .
among the many bandleaders performing a backup role with berry in the 1970s were bruce springsteen and steve miller when each was just starting his career .
=== 19802017 : last years on the road === berry continued to play 70 to 100 one-nighters per year in the 1980s , still traveling solo and requiring a local band to back him at each stop .
gene simmons of kiss gave an impromptu , unadvertised eulogy at the service , while little richard was scheduled to lead the funeral procession but did not show up due to an illness .
`` berry contributed three things to rock music : an irresistible swagger , a focus on the guitar riff as the primary melodic element and an emphasis on songwriting as storytelling .
his records are a rich storehouse of the essential lyrical , showmanship and musical components of rock and roll .
`` ) the rock critic robert christgau considers berry `` the greatest of the rock and rollers '' , while john lennon said , `` if you tried to give rock and roll another name , you might call it 'chuck berry ' .
`` ted nugent said , `` if you do n't know every chuck berry lick , you ca n't play rock guitar .
`` bob dylan called berry `` the shakespeare of rock 'n ' roll '' .
springsteen tweeted , `` chuck berry was rock 's greatest practitioner , guitarist , and the greatest pure rock 'n ' roll writer who ever lived .
the journalist chuck klosterman has argued that in 300 years berry will still be remembered as the rock musician who most closely captured the essence of rock and roll .
2324 , april 20 , 2017 ) kevin strait , curator of the national museum of african american history and culture in washington , dc , said that berry is `` one of the primary sonic architects of rock and roll .
`` yes , chuck berry invented rock 'n ' roll  and singer-songwriters .
after releasing two albums with the band , numan released his debut solo album the pleasure principle in 1979 .
his signature sound consists of heavy synthesizer hooks fed through guitar effects pedals , and he is considered a pioneer of commercial electronic music .
numan is also known for his distinctive voice and androgynous `` android '' persona .
the pleasure principle was a rock album with no guitars ; instead , numan used synthesizers fed through guitar effects pedals to achieve a distorted , phased , metallic tone .
the album featured several distinguished guest players ; mick karn ( bass , saxophone ) and rob dean ( guitar ) of japan , roger mason ( keyboards ) of models , and roger taylor ( drums ) of queen .
however , numan 's career had begun to experience a gradual decline , and he was eclipsed initially by acts such as adam ant , and later by the human league , duran duran , and depeche mode .
12 , produced two hit singles including the top 20 title track and , like i , assassin , spent six weeks in the charts .
the album was also accompanied by a new blue-and-white visual image ( including numan himself with blue hair ) , a tour , a live album/video/ep , and the title track reached the uk top 40 when released as a single .
=== 1990s === in 1991 , numan ventured into film-scoring by co-composing the music for the unborn with michael r. smith ( the score was later released as an instrumental album in 1995 , human ) .
by 1994 , numan decided to stop attempting to crack the pop market and concentrate instead on exploring more personal themes , including his vocal atheism .
numan re-evaluated his career and veered toward a harsher , more industrial direction with his songwriting on the album sacrificefor the first time he played almost all the instruments himself .
the move was critically well-received , as numan 's harder and darker sound emerged just as numan-influenced bands like nine inch nails were enjoying their first rush of fame .
in 2000 , dj armand van helden sampled the track and mixed it up in his single `` koochy '' which conquered the dancefloors .
in 2002 , uk pop trio sugababes scored a no .
rico also worked on the remix album hybrid which featured reworkings of older songs in a more contemporary industrial style as well as new material .
2003 also saw numan performing the vocals on a track named `` pray for you '' on the plump djs album eargasm .
numan lent his vocals to the track `` my machines '' on battles 's 2011 album gloss drop .
in june 2014 , numan collaborated with jayce lewis and his protafield project on the track `` redesign '' featured on protafield 's nemesis album .
his best known works include the theme to the pink panther film series ( `` the pink panther theme '' ) , `` moon river '' to breakfast at tiffany 's , and the theme to the peter gunn television series .
the peter gunn theme won the first grammy award for album of the year .
mancini 's father , quinto ( born march 13 , 1893 , scanno , italy ) was a steelworker , who made his only child begin piccolo lessons at the age of eight .
when mancini was 12 years old , he began piano lessons .
mancini 's score for the alfred hitchcock film frenzy ( 1972 ) in bachian organ andante , for organ and an orchestra of strings was rejected and replaced by ron goodwin 's work .
mancini also composed the `` viewer mail '' theme for late night with david letterman .
mancini composed the theme for nbc nightly news used beginning in 1975 , and a different theme by him , titled salute to the president was used by nbc news for its election coverage ( including primaries and conventions ) from 1976 to 1992 .
salute to the president was only published in a school-band arrangement , although mancini performed it frequently with symphony orchestras on his concert tours .
mancini recorded over 90 albums , in styles ranging from big band to light classical to pop .
mancini was also a concert performer , conducting over fifty engagements per year , resulting in over 600 symphony performances during his lifetime .
he also toured several times with johnny mathis and also with andy williams , who had each sung many of mancini 's songs ; mathis and mancini collaborated on the 1986 album the hollywood musicals .
in 1987 he conducted an impromptu charity concert in london in aid of children in need .
mancini voiced the character al , who speaks with a melancholy drawl and hates the sound of his own voice , in the episode `` guess who 's coming to breakfast ?
mancini also had an uncredited performance as a pianist in the 1967 movie gunn , the movie version of the series peter gunn , the score of which was composed by mancini .
in the 1966 pink panther cartoon pink , plunk , plink , the panther commandeered an orchestra and proceeded to conduct mancini 's theme for the series .
mancini also made a brief appearance in the title sequence of 1993 's son of the pink panther , allowing the panther to conduct bobby mcferrin in performing the film 's theme tune .
the program includes dance , voice , musical theater , and instrumental lessons .
39 on their list of the greatest songs and his score for the pink panther no .
== discography == === hit singles === === albums === === soundtracks === note : most of mancini 's scores were not released on lp soundtrack albums .
his tv movie music albums were not soundtrack albums but are titled `` music from ... '' or `` music from the motion picture ... '' he routinely retained the rights to his music .
mancini 's contracts allowed him to release his own albums for which he rearranged the score music into arrangements more appropriate for listening outside of the context of the film/theater .
actual film scores using players from hollywood unions recording under major motion picture studio contracts were expensive to release on lp ( ex : the soundtrack for 'our man flint ' ( not a mancini score ) cost $ 1 more than other lp albums of the day ) .
many soundtrack albums used to claim `` original soundtrack '' or words to that effect , but were not necessarily the actual soundtrack recordings .
these albums were usually recorded with a smaller orchestra than that used for the actual scoring ( ex : dimitri tiomkin 's score to 'the alamo ' ) .
however , many hollywood musicians were featured on mancini 's albums recorded in rca 's hollywood recording studios and faux `` original soundtrack '' albums .
his composition `` jelly roll blues '' , published in 1915 , was the first published jazz composition .
however , the scholar katy martin has argued that morton 's bragging was exaggerated by alan lomax in his book mister jelly roll , and this portrayal has influenced public opinion and scholarship on morton since .
=== career === at the age of fourteen , morton began working as a piano player in a brothel ( or , as it was referred to then , a sporting house ) .
he got to chicago in 1910 and new york city in 1911 , where future stride greats james p. johnson and willie `` the lion '' smith caught his act , years before the blues were widely played in the north .
in 1915 , his `` jelly roll blues '' was arguably the first jazz composition ever published , recording as sheet music the new orleans traditions that had been jealously guarded by musicians .
in 1917 , he followed the bandleader william manuel johnson and johnson 's sister anita gonzalez to california , where morton 's tango , `` the crave '' , was a sensation in hollywood .
=== chicago === morton returned to chicago in 1923 to claim authorship of his recently published rag , `` the wolverines '' , which had become a hit as `` wolverine blues '' in that city .
he released the first of his commercial recordings , first as piano rolls , then on record , both as a piano soloist and with various jazz bands .
his piano solos and trio recordings are well regarded , but his band recordings suffer in comparison with the chicago sides , for which morton could draw on many great new orleans musicians as sidemen .
in 1935 , morton 's 30-year-old composition `` king porter stomp '' , as arranged by fletcher henderson , became benny goodman 's first hit and a swing standard , but morton received no royalties from its recordings .
the sessions , originally intended to be a short interview with musical examples for use by music researchers in the library of congress , expanded to more than eight hours of morton talking and playing piano .
) == piano style == morton 's piano style was formed from early secondary ragtime and `` shout '' , which also evolved separately into the new york school of stride piano .
morton 's playing was also close to barrelhouse , which produced boogie-woogie .
he played basic swing rhythms with both the left and the right hand .
several of morton 's compositions were musical tributes to himself , including `` winin ' boy '' , `` the jelly roll blues '' ( subtitled `` the original jelly-roll '' ) ; and `` mr. jelly lord '' .
in the big-band era , his `` king porter stomp '' , which morton had written decades earlier , was a big hit for fletcher henderson and benny goodman ; it became a standard covered by most other swing bands of that time .
`` sweet peter '' , which morton recorded in 1926 , appears to be the source of the melody of the hit song `` all of me , '' which was credited to gerald marks and seymour simons in 1931 .
morton appears as the piano `` professor '' in louis malle 's pretty baby , where he is portrayed by the actor antonio fargas , with piano and vocals by james booker .
morton is featured in alessandro baricco 's book novecento .
he is the `` inventor of jazz '' and the protagonist 's rival throughout the book .
this book was adapted as a movie , the legend of 1900 , directed by giuseppe tornatore , in which morton is played by clarence williams iii .
albert first considered becoming a minister but instead turned to the study of mathematics and physics and received his ph.d. degree at stanford university in 1950 .
== music career == the opening line of baez 's memoir and a voice to sing with is `` i was born gifted '' ( referencing her singing voice , which she explained was given to her and for which she can take no credit ) .
baez later met bob gibson and odetta , who were at the time two of the most prominent vocalists singing folk and gospel music .
the performance generated substantial praise for the `` barefoot madonna '' with the otherworldly voice , and it was this appearance that led to baez signing with vanguard records the following year although columbia records tried to sign her first .
baez 's nickname at the time , `` madonna '' , has been attributed to her clear voice , long hair , and natural beauty , and to her role as `` earth mother '' .
the collection of traditional folk ballads , blues , and laments sung to her own guitar accompaniment sold moderately well .
robert shelton , folk critic of the new york times , praised the concert , saying , `` that superb soprano voice , as lustrous and rich as old gold , flowed purely all evening with a wondrous ease .
her singing ( unwound ) like a spool of satin .
2 contained strictly traditional material .
baez added other instruments to her recordings on farewell , angelina ( 1965 ) , which features several dylan songs interspersed with more traditional fare .
nol was a christmas album of traditional material , while baptism was akin to a concept album , featuring baez reading and singing poems written by celebrated poets such as james joyce , federico garca lorca , and walt whitman .
joan featured interpretations of work by then-contemporary composers , including john lennon and paul mccartney , tim hardin , paul simon , and donovan .
she was one of the first musicians to use her popularity as a vehicle for social protest , singing and marching for human rights and peace .
of her fourteen vanguard albums , thirteen made the top 100 of billboard 's mainstream pop chart , eleven made the top forty , eight made the top twenty , and four made the top ten .
she delivered them one last success with the gold-selling album blessed are ... ( 1971 ) which included a top-ten hit in `` the night they drove old dixie down '' , her cover of the band 's signature song .
half spoken word poem and half tape-recorded sounds , the song documented baez 's visit to hanoi , north vietnam , in december 1972 during which she and her traveling companions survived the 11-day-long christmas bombings campaign over hanoi and haiphong .
flirting with mainstream pop music as well as writing her own songs for diamonds & rust ( 1975 ) , the album became the highest selling of baez 's career and included a second top-ten single in the form of the title track .
then , on january 13 , 2006 , baez performed at the funeral of lou rawls , where she led jesse jackson , sr. , wonder , and others in the singing of `` amazing grace '' .
on june 6 , 2006 , baez joined bruce springsteen on stage at his san francisco concert , where the two performed the rolling anthem `` pay me my money down '' .
she also joined the choir in the finale of `` o holy night '' .
in addition , baez recorded a duet of `` jim crow '' with john mellencamp which appears on his album freedom 's road ( 2007 ) .
he has called the album a `` woody guthrie rock album '' .
during the concert 's finale , she spontaneously danced on stage with a band of african percussionists .
a dvd and cd of the soundtrack were released at the same time .
it is the most detailed report of her life through 1966 and outlined her anti-war position , dedicating the book to men facing imprisonment for resisting the draft .
because many of the south central farmers are immigrants from central america , baez sang several songs from her 1974 spanish-language album , gracias a la vida , including the title track and `` no nos movern '' ( `` we shall not be moved '' ) .
if he had taken his brilliance , his eloquence , his toughness and not run for office he could have led a movement .
she performed at the white house on february 10 , 2010 , as part of an evening celebrating the music associated with the civil rights movement , performing `` we shall overcome '' .
her three-song set included `` joe hill '' , a cover of the rolling stones ' `` salt of the earth '' and her own composition `` where 's my apple pie ?
the two performed the dylan composition `` with god on our side '' , a performance that set the stage for many more duets like it in the months and years to come .
in `` to bobby '' , written in 1972 , she urged dylan to return to political activism , while in `` diamonds & rust '' , the title track from her 1975 album , she revisited her feelings for him in warm , yet direct terms .
capp had this character singing bizarre songs such as `` a tale of bagels and bacon '' and `` molotov cocktails for two '' .
== history == comic characters had been a part of opera until the early 18th century , when `` opera buffa '' began to emerge as a separate genre , an early precursor having been the operatic comedy , il trespolo tutore , by alessandro stradella , in 1679 .
opera buffa was a parallel development to opera seria and arose in reaction to the so-called first reform of zeno and metastasio .
whereas opera seria was an entertainment that was both made for and depicted kings and nobility , opera buffa was made for and depicted common people with more common problems .
in the early 18th century , comic operas often appeared as short , one-act interludes known as intermezzi that were performed in between acts of opera seria .
these gave way to the full-fledged opera buffa later in the 18th century .
apart from pergolesi , the first major composers of opera buffa were nicola logroscino , baldassare galuppi and alessandro scarlatti , all of them based in naples or venice .
the opera buffa 's importance diminished during the romantic period .
another example of romantic opera buffa would be donizetti 's l'elisir d'amore of 1832 .
== relation to and differences from opera seria == while opera seria deals with gods and ancient heroes and only occasionally contained comic scenes , opera buffa involves the predominant use of comic scenes , characters , and plot lines in a contemporary setting .
the traditional model for opera seria had three acts , dealt with serious subjects in mythical settings , as stated above , and used high voices ( both sopranos and castrati ) for principal characters , often even for monarchs .
in contrast , the model that generally held for opera buffa was having two acts ( as , for example , the barber of seville ) , presenting comic scenes and situations as earlier stated and using the lower male voices to the exclusion of the castrati .
hunter , mary ( 1999 ) , the culture of opera buffa in mozart 's vienna : a poetics of entertainment .
most researchers acknowledge that the credit for creating the operetta form should go to herv ( 18251892 ) , a singer , composer , librettist , conductor , and scene painter .
=== offenbach === jacques offenbach further developed and popularized operetta , giving it its enormous vogue during the second empire and afterwards .
offenbach 's earliest one-act pieces included les deux aveugles , le violoneux and ba-ta-clan ( all 1855 ) , and his first full-length operetta success was orphe aux enfers ( 1858 ) .
what characterizes offenbach 's operettas is both the grotesque way they portray life , and the extremely frivolous way this is done , often bordering on the pornographic .
mile zola describes the back-stage and on-stage situation in the thtre des varits during the second empire in his novel nana , which takes place in late 1860s and describes the career of operetta diva/courtesan nana .
considering how zola 's nana describes an offenbach-style operetta performance in paris , it is not surprising that the mostly male , upper-class audience crowded the various theaters every evening .
the highly erotic way offenbach 's operettas were originally played , with stars like hortense schneider created a scandalized reaction from certain parts of the general public .
indeed , together with its grotesque qualities , frivolity is one of the defining elements of `` authentic '' operetta  la offenbach and herv .
it was only later , when audiences widened and became more middle and lower class , that operetta became more `` serious '' and `` nostalgic '' .
== operetta in german == === austria-hungary === the most significant composer of operetta in the german language was the austrian johann strauss ii ( 18251899 ) .
his first operetta was indigo und die vierzig ruber ( 1871 ) .
his third operetta , die fledermaus ( 1874 ) , became the most performed operetta in the world , and remains his most popular stage work .
in all , strauss wrote 16 operettas and one opera , most with great success when first premiered .
many of his lesser operettas are now largely forgotten , since his later librettists were less talented and he often composed independently of the plot .
strauss 's operettas , waltzes , polkas , and marches often have a strongly viennese style , and his popularity causes many to think of him as the national composer of austria .
franz von supp , a contemporary of strauss , closely modeled his operettas after offenbach .
=== germany === in the same way that vienna was the center of austrian operetta , berlin was the center of german operetta .
berlin operettas also sometimes included aspects of burlesque , revue , farce , or cabaret .
paul lincke pioneered the berlin operetta in 1899 with frau luna , which includes `` berliner luft '' ( `` berlin air '' ) , which became the unofficial anthem of berlin .
much later , in the 1920s and 1930s , kurt weill took a more extreme form of the berlin operetta style and used it in his operas , operettas , and musicals .
the berlin-style operetta coexisted with more bourgeois , charming , home-loving , and nationalistic german operettassome of which were called volksoperetten ( folk operettas ) .
these bucolic , nostalgic , home-loving operettas were officially preferred over berlin-style operettas after 1933 , when the nazis came to power and instituted the reichsmusikkammer ( state music institute ) , which deprecated and banned `` decadent '' music like jazz and similar `` foreign '' musical forms .
notable german operetta composers include paul lincke , eduard knneke , walter kollo , jean gilbert , leon jessel , rudolf dellinger , walter goetze and ludwig schmidseder .
== operetta in english == english-language operettas were first composed in england by the 1860s , for example , arthur sullivan 's cox and box ( 1866 ) .
sullivan and gilbert and their producer richard d'oyly carte themselves call their joint works comic operas to distinguish this family-friendly fare from the risqu french operettas of the 1850s and 1860s .
english operetta continued into the 1890s , with works by composers such as edward german , ivan caryll and sidney jones .
beginning in 1907 , with the merry widow , many of the viennese operettas were adapted very successfully for the english stage .
american operetta composers included victor herbert , whose works at the beginning of the 20th century were influenced by both viennese operetta and gilbert and sullivan .
more modern american operettas include leonard bernstein 's candide .
nevertheless , american operetta largely gave way , by the end of world war i , to musicals , such as the princess theatre musicals , and revues , followed by the musicals of rodgers and hart , cole porter , irving berlin and others .
likewise , some of leonard bernstein 's works he designated as operas ( e.g.
, trouble in tahiti ) are categorized as operettas , and his operetta candide is sometimes considered a musical .
while an opera 's story is usually believable and more relatable to its audience , an operetta aims to simply amuse .
topical satire is a feature common to many operettas .
normally some of the libretto of an operetta is spoken rather than sung .
aria , recitative , chorusare interspersed with periods of dialogue .
there is usually no musical accompaniment to the dialogue , although sometimes some musical themes are played quietly under it .
short passages of recitative are , however , sometimes used in operetta , especially as an introduction to a song .
=== operettas and musicals === the operetta is a precursor of the modern musical theatre or the `` musical '' .
in the early decades of the 20th century , the operetta continued to exist alongside the newer musical , with each influencing the other .
the main difference between the two genres is that most operettas can be described as light operas with acting , whereas most musicals are plays with singing and dancing .
